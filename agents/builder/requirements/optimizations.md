After reviewing the codebase, here are the issues and recommendations:

1. **State Inconsistencies**:
   - `page_summaries` is typed as `Dict[int, str]` but used as a list in code
   - Some state fields like `pdf_analysis` appear unused
   - `awaiting_input` only has one literal type "pdf_upload" but could be expanded

2. **Unused or Redundant Code**:
   - `test_graph.py` seems outdated (from Jan 10)
   - `monitoring.py` was removed but some monitoring references remain
   - Multiple CSV handling approaches between `tables.py` and `summary.py`

3. **Flow Issues**:
   - No clear error recovery path in the graph
   - Missing validation steps between nodes
   - No retry mechanism for failed API calls in some nodes

4. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - `builder_agent.md` and `deck_layout_types.md` might be out of sync
   - Missing documentation for some node functions
   - Unclear type definitions for some state properties

Here's what I recommend fixing:

1. **State Cleanup**:
```python
class BuilderState(TypedDict):
    """State management for the deck building process."""
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    metadata: DeckMetadata
    slides: list[dict]
    audio_config: Optional[dict]
    error_context: Optional[dict]
    deck_info: Optional[Dict[str, str]]
    awaiting_input: Optional[Literal["pdf_upload", "validation", "audio"]]
    pdf_path: Optional[str]
    pdf_info: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    page_summaries: Optional[list[dict]]  # List of page summaries
    processed_summaries: Optional[str]
```

2. **Node Standardization**:
   - All nodes should follow same error handling pattern
   - Consistent API call retry mechanism
   - Standard logging format

3. **Graph Improvements**:
   - Add validation nodes
   - Implement proper error recovery paths
   - Add retry logic for failed steps

4. **File Organization**:
   - Move types to separate file
   - Create constants file for shared values
   - Standardize node structure

5. **Remove/Update**:
   - Update or remove outdated test files
   - Clean up unused state fields
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality

Would you like me to:
1. Create a detailed cleanup plan?
2. Start with fixing any specific area?
3. Show you specific code changes for any of these improvements?

The most critical issues to address first would be:
1. State type inconsistencies
2. Standardizing error handling across nodes
3. Improving the graph flow with proper validation

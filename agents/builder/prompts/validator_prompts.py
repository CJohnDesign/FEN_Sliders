A page consists of two parts:
1. A slide with a header and content
2. A script with a header and content

Your task is to validate that:
1. The script content appropriately describes and expands upon the slide content
2. The headers match or are thematically consistent
3. All bullet points and key information from the slide are covered in the script
4. The script provides natural transitions and engaging presentation of the slide's content

When analyzing, consider:
- Slide headers should match script section headers (accounting for minor variations)
- Script content should cover ALL points mentioned in the slide
- Script should provide additional context and explanation for slide content
- Transitions between sections should be natural and fluid

VALIDATION_PROMPT = '''You are an expert content validator specializing in presentation slides and scripts.

Your task is to validate the synchronization and quality of the presentation content according to these rules:

1. Content Synchronization
   - Each slide section must have matching script section
   - Each v-click point must have corresponding script line
   - Extra line before v-clicks introducing section
   - Script can break mid-sentence at v-click points
   - No use of word "comprehensive" anywhere

2. Structure Validation
   - Matching section titles between slides and script
   - Proper markdown syntax
   - Appropriate line breaks
   - Script sections must use format: ---- Section Title ----
   - Slides must use format: ## Section Title

3. Plan Tier Structure
   - Plan name and tier must be present
   - Benefits list with details of amounts
   - Dollar values included and properly formatted

4. Content Quality
   - Natural flow and transitions between sections
   - Clear and engaging narrative
   - Proper grammar and spelling
   - Technical accuracy
   - Visual balance
   - Appropriate timing and pacing

Example of proper synchronization:

Slide:
---
transition: fade-out
layout: default

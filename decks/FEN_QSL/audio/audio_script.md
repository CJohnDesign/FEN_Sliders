Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the QuestSelect Plan. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to the QuestSelect Plan ----

The QuestSelect Plan is powered by Quest Diagnostics

This Unlimited Lab Program will significantly help reduce unnecessy outpatient lab spend 

and provides members with a $0 Copay option for over 1,000 outpatient lab tests!

---- QuestSelect Plan 1 Benefits ----

Now let's dive into the QuestSelect Plan 1 Benefits, which focuses on lab coverage.

The plan offers exceptional value with zero copay, zero deductibles, and zero coinsurance for eligible outpatient lab services.

What's covered under this plan includes, but not limited to, essential testing like blood work including cholesterol testing, urinalysis, Pap smears, biopsies, and cultures. These are the most commonly needed outpatient lab services.

However, it's important to understand what's not covered. The plan doesn't include lab work performed during hospitalization, emergency or STAT lab work, time-sensitive esoteric testing, fertility testing, bone marrow studies, or spinal fluid tests. Additionally, non-laboratory work such as mammography, x-ray, imaging, and dental work are excluded. Lab work performed without using this program and testing not approved by your current health benefit plan are also not covered.

Remember, this is not insurance. This service does not provide money, funds, or any type of reimbursement to pay medical bills. Not all labs are eligible under the zero copay service, so it's important to verify coverage before proceeding with testing.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

Now let's review the important limitations and exclusions that apply to these plans.

Unlike other lab programs, QuestSelect does not include a pre-existing limitation, or any other exclusions. 

Additionally, there is no waiting period.

---- How to use the QuestSelect ----

Now let's walk through how members can use their QuestSelect benefits step by step.

At the appointment, the member needs to show their QuestSelect card and ask their doctor to send their lab work to Quest. It's important to note that using QuestSelect is optional - if they don't use their QuestSelect card, their regular benefits will apply.

If their doctor's office doesn't use Quest, ask them to call the QuestSelect Lab Line to pick up the member's test sample. The Lab Line number is conveniently located on the member's QuestSelect card.

After the member's appointment, if they learn that their lab work did NOT go to Quest for processing, they need to call the QuestSelect Lab Line for help. The Lab Line team will contact the member's doctor about getting future tests sent to Quest.

Finally, members can access their results anytime, anywhere through MyQuest online, making it convenient to stay on top of their health information.

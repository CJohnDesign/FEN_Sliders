We'll walk through the plan's offerings and benefits.

Focusing on both indemnity and managed care options with benefits and services.

Let's get started!

---- MyChoice Plan Overview ----

The Basic Core insurance plans, provided by American Public Life Insurance Company, offer two primary options: Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus. These plans fall under managed care, ensuring comprehensive coverage without waiting or exclusion periods for pre-existing conditions, although pregnancy is not included.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

One of the standout features of these plans is the absence of waiting or exclusion periods, allowing for immediate coverage without delays.

Additionally, the Medical Bill Repricer Services enable members to select any doctor with predetermined payment amounts for visits, leveraging Reference-Based Pricing to cut costs.

Another key feature is the Advocacy and Concierge Services, which provide personal assistance in navigating health plans and filing claims.

For the Basic Core-Plus plan, members benefit from free generic medications, unlimited telemedicine visits offering 24/7 access to virtual consultations with no copay, and a Free Prescription Club that supplies acute and chronic medications, diabetic supplies, and pharmacy coaching at no charge.

Both plans incorporate Medical Bill Repricing.  

And Reference-Based Pricing, a cost containment method that pays between 150% to 200% of Medicare Allowable Rates.  

This approach significantly reduces healthcare expenses for members.

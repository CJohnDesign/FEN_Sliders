Hello, agents! Thank you for joining today's training session on Sigma Care Plus. As sales professionals, you'll need to understand this plan's benefits thoroughly to effectively present them to your prospective members. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to Sigma Care Plus ----

Sigma Care Plus, underwritten by American Financial Security Life Insurance Company (AFSLIC), is a product you'll be offering that provides 

flexible coverage for various medical situations. 

When presenting to prospects, emphasize how it combines hospital indemnity benefits with extensive support tools to help members navigate their healthcare journey. 

Membership is available through the National Congress of Employers, which you should refer to as NCE when speaking with prospects, granting access to these exclusive benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let's explore the key features you'll be highlighting to prospects. 

Hospital Confinement Benefits provide daily financial support when your members are admitted to a hospital, ranging from one hundred to one thousand dollars per day depending on the plan level. 

Doctor Office Visit Benefits cover both primary care and specialty care visits, giving prospects peace of mind for routine healthcare needs. 

Emergency Room Benefits ensure your members have coverage for unexpected medical emergencies, with most plans providing fifty to one hundred dollars per visit. 

Mental Health Benefits on Plans 300 and higher offer both inpatient and outpatient coverage, addressing the growing demand for mental healthcare support. 

Diagnostic and Surgery Benefits on higher-tier plans provide coverage for essential medical tests and surgical procedures, creating excellent upselling opportunities. 

Accident and Critical Illness Benefits include supplemental accident coverage that pays in addition to regular benefits, plus critical illness protection for serious health diagnoses. 

---- NCE Healthcare & Medical Services ----

When discussing the healthcare and medical services offered through the National Congress of Employers association, you'll want to emphasize the value proposition. 

Your prospects will receive medical support including bill negotiations, 24/7 nurse access, laboratory savings, and discounts on medical supplies. 

For dental and vision care, NCE provides significant savings through the Aetna Dental Access Network and OUTLOOK Vision Network, offering 15 to 50 percent savings on routine and specialty services that you can highlight as immediate value. Please note that these programs are not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington.

---- NCE Prescription & Health Products ----

Next, here's how you'll present the prescription and health product benefits to prospects.

NCE offers substantial prescription savings with discount cards and specialized programs, including significant savings on diabetic supplies and insulin medications that can resonate strongly with prospects who have these needs.

Your prospects will also have access to natural health products including CBD alternatives and vitamins with savings up to 75 percent off retail pricing - a compelling selling point for health-conscious individuals.

---- NCE Therapy & Wellness Services ----

When presenting therapy and wellness services, you'll want to emphasize the nature of these benefits.

This includes physical therapy, chiropractic care, speech therapy, and hearing services through extensive provider networks that your prospects can access immediately upon enrollment.

Your members will also get access to nutrition education and wellness programs to support their overall health goals, which appeals to prospects looking for holistic health support.

Remember to mention that National Congress of Employers NCE association benefits are not affiliated with American Financial Security Life Insurance Company. Sigma Care Plus Plan benefits are not dependent on the use of the association's providers. NCE membership is available without purchasing this plan. The benefits listed are not insurance and do not provide coverage, they only provide discounts and services. Benefit discounts and services vary by state. Please note that Aetna Dental Access Network and OUTLOOK Vision Network programs are not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington.

---- Sigma Care Plus Plan Options ----

Now let's review the Sigma Care Plus plan options you'll be presenting to prospects. You'll be offering eight different plan levels to meet various needs and budgets, ranging from Plan 100A up to Plan 1000. 

When presenting Hospital Confinement Benefits, you can show prospects the range from one hundred dollars per day on the lower plans up to one thousand dollars per day on the highest plan. All plans provide coverage for up to 30 days per year.

For Doctor Visit Benefits, point out this important distinction to prospects. Most plans provide fifty dollars per visit for both primary care and specialty care, while Plan 1000 increases this to seventy-five dollars per visit.

Visit Limits also vary by plan level, giving you another selling point. The lower plans allow 3 visits per year for each category, while the higher plans allow 5 visits per year.

Finally, Emergency Room benefits highlight a key difference you should explain clearly. Plan 100A doesn't include emergency room coverage at all, while other plans range from fifty dollars to one hundred dollars per visit, with most plans allowing one emergency room visit per year.

This flexible structure allows you to help prospects choose the plan that best matches their healthcare needs and budget.

---- Additional Benefits - Diagnostics & Surgery ----

Now let's examine the additional benefits available on higher-tier plans that you can use as compelling upselling opportunities.

When presenting diagnostic benefits, explain to prospects that certain plans include coverage for essential medical tests. Plans 200, 200 Plus, 500, 750, and 1000 provide Basic Pathology and Basic Radiology benefits. Notice that Plan 1000 offers seventy-five dollars per day compared to fifty dollars on other plans, giving you a clear value proposition for the premium plan.

For Surgery Benefits, this is where you can really differentiate the higher plans. Starting with Plan 200 Plus, prospects get both inpatient and outpatient surgery coverage. Point out the significant range from four hundred dollars per day on Plan 200 Plus up to fifteen hundred dollars per day on Plan 1000. All surgery plans allow up to 3 procedures per year.

An important selling point is the Anesthesia Benefit, which provides an additional twenty percent of the surgery benefit amount. This means on Plan 1000, if a prospect has surgery worth fifteen hundred dollars, they'd receive an additional three hundred dollars for anesthesia costs.

Remember to explain the important limitations: for diagnostic tests, if multiple tests occur on the same day, only the highest benefit amount is paid. For surgery, if both inpatient and outpatient procedures happen the same day, only the inpatient benefit is paid since it's typically higher.

These additional benefits make the higher-tier plans particularly attractive to prospects concerned about potential surgical procedures or diagnostic testing costs.

---- Mental Health Benefits ----

Mental Health Benefits represent a significant differentiator and upselling opportunity starting with Plan 300. When presenting these benefits to prospects, emphasize that mental health coverage has become increasingly important to many families and employers.

Plans 300 through 1000 provide robust inpatient mental health benefits ranging from one hundred fifty dollars per day on Plan 300 up to five hundred dollars per day on Plan 1000, with generous coverage of up to 60 days per year. This substantial coverage addresses the growing need for psychiatric hospital care and mental health facility stays.

All these higher-tier plans also include outpatient mental health benefits at fifty dollars per day for up to 20 visits annually, covering therapy sessions and outpatient psychiatric care. This benefit alone can save prospects hundreds or thousands of dollars in annual mental health costs.

When presenting mental health benefits, position them as essential coverage for today's stress-filled world and emphasize that these benefits are only available on Plans 300 and higher, making them excellent upselling tools.

---- Premium Accident & Critical Illness Benefits ----

Now let's explore the accident and critical illness benefits that create additional value propositions across multiple plan levels.

Supplemental Accident Benefits are a powerful selling tool available on Plans 300 and higher. These benefits are crucial because they pay in addition to regular hospital and emergency room benefits, effectively doubling the coverage for accident-related care. For accident-related emergency room visits, prospects receive an additional two hundred fifty dollars per day. For accident-related hospital admissions, they receive an additional five hundred dollars per day, with higher plans offering more days of coverage.

Accidental Death Benefits provide peace of mind and are available on all plans except 100A. You can position this as a ten thousand dollar accidental death benefit at no additional cost. Remember to explain that spouses receive fifty percent, or five thousand dollars, and dependents receive twenty-five percent, or twenty-five hundred dollars.

Critical Illness Benefits start with Plan 200 Plus and provide one thousand dollars per original diagnosis per family member. This is particularly appealing to prospects with family histories of serious illness, as it provides immediate cash assistance when facing major health challenges like cancer, heart attack, or stroke.

These accident and critical illness benefits transform the plans from simple hospital coverage into protection packages.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

As agents, you need to understand the key limitations of Sigma Care Plus plans to properly set expectations with your prospects.

There's a thirty-day waiting period for sickness benefits and a twelve-month exclusion for pre-existing conditions treated before coverage begins.

The main exclusions include treatments that aren't medically necessary, experimental procedures, dental care except for accidents, cosmetic surgery, pregnancy complications, self-inflicted injuries, extreme sports, military duty, and work-related injuries covered by Workers' Compensation.

Remember to emphasize that these are fixed indemnity benefits with usage limitations per policy year. Always direct prospects to the complete policy certificate for full details.

---- Key Takeaways for Sigma Care Plus Sales ----

As agents, remember these crucial selling points when presenting Sigma Care Plus: 

With eight different plan levels from 100A through 1000, you can match any prospect's budget and coverage needs while creating natural upselling opportunities. 

Mental Health Benefits starting on Plan 300 provide a powerful differentiator in today's market, addressing the growing awareness and need for mental healthcare coverage. 

Supplemental Accident and Critical Illness Benefits on Plans 300 and higher pay in addition to regular hospital benefits, with accident benefits doubling accident-related coverage and critical illness benefits providing immediate cash for serious diagnoses - compelling selling points for safety and health-conscious prospects. 

NCE Association Benefits provide extensive healthcare discounts and services at no extra cost, adding tremendous value beyond the insurance coverage itself. 

And remember, these are fixed indemnity benefits that pay regardless of other insurance coverage your prospects may have, making this an excellent supplement to existing health plans.

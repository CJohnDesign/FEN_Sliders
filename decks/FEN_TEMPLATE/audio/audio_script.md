Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today’s session on the Paramount Plan. We’ll walk through the plan’s comprehensive benefits, explain how it helps control healthcare costs, and discuss how membership through the Business Workers of America (BWA) makes these benefits possible.

---- Paramount Plan Overview ----

This section highlights the essential details and benefits of the Paramount Plan. It’s designed to help you understand how the plan can address diverse healthcare needs and offer meaningful cost savings.

---- Introduction to the Paramount Plan ----

The Paramount Plan provides flexible coverage for various medical situations. It combines hospital indemnity benefits with extensive support tools to help members navigate their healthcare journey. Membership is available through BWA, granting access to these exclusive benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Hospital Admission Benefits give members financial support when they’re admitted to a hospital. ICU Confinement Benefits provide an additional layer of protection for intensive care stays. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement Benefits extend coverage for multiple days. Certain plans include Surgical and Ambulance Benefits for more comprehensive protection. Prescription Savings Programs through HealthWarehouse help members save on medications.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Medical Bill Repricing (MBR) negotiates hospital and medical bills on behalf of members, lowering out-of-pocket expenses. A Reference-Based Pricing System ensures fair and competitive rates from healthcare providers. Financial Assistance Guidance helps members handle billing issues and navigate the payment process.

---- How the Plan Works ----

Members enroll through BWA and then seek healthcare services as needed. Medical bills are submitted to MBR, and after negotiation, members receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The final step is paying the reduced balance, simplifying the process and providing valuable cost savings.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Annual Wellness Exams help detect health issues early. Preventive Screenings address potential risks before they become serious. DirectLabs makes it straightforward for members to obtain recommended lab tests without hassle.

---- Telehealth Services ----

24/7 Virtual Doctor Visits allow access to healthcare providers anytime, avoiding inconvenient clinic appointments. No Consultation Fees mean members can consult a doctor as often as needed. This service is both convenient and efficient, and it can also provide necessary prescriptions.

---- Advocacy and Support Services ----

Concierge-style healthcare advocacy guides members through provider selection and explains plan benefits. There’s support for finding financial assistance options if needed. Additionally, the plan offers help throughout the claims process to reduce confusion and stress.

---- Paramount 1 Plan (1/2) ----

This plan offers a First Day Hospital Confinement payment, plus a separate first-day benefit for ICU. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement coverage continues beyond the first day. There’s an Emergency Room Treatment benefit and coverage for Chiropractic Visits, Doctor’s Office Visits, and Urgent Care. Air and Ground Ambulance benefits are included, along with an annual Wellness Visit allowance.

---- Paramount 1 Plan (2/2) ----

Pre-Existing Condition Limitations apply for the first 12 months. Normal Pregnancy Coverage is included, with no waiting period. However, Portability is not provided for this plan. There’s no Annual Benefit Maximum, and no Benefit Waiting Period beyond enrollment. Benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- Paramount 2 Plan (1/2) ----

The first-day benefits for Hospital and ICU Confinement are the same as Paramount 1, but the ICU benefit from Day 2 forward is higher. There’s coverage for Emergency Room Treatment, Doctor’s Office Visits, and Urgent Care visits. Air Ambulance, Ground Ambulance, and an annual Wellness Visit are also part of this plan.

Inpatient Surgery is covered at a higher benefit level, and Outpatient Surgery comes with a separate benefit. Emergency Room Treatment, Chiropractic Visits, Doctor’s Office Visits, and Urgent Care are also included. Air Ambulance coverage is higher compared to the previous plans.

---- Paramount 3 Plan (2/2) ----

Pre-Existing Condition Limitations remain the same, with a 12-month waiting period. Normal Pregnancy Coverage applies, with no waiting period. There is no Portability and no Annual Benefit Maximum. No Benefit Waiting Period is required, and benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- Comparing the 3 Paramount Plans ----

Plan 1 includes Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement benefits but excludes Inpatient Surgery, Outpatient Surgery, or Air Ambulance beyond a basic level. Plan 2 adds a higher ICU daily rate and introduces Inpatient Surgery benefits. Plan 3 brings the highest level of coverage, including both Inpatient and Outpatient Surgery benefits, along with an Air Ambulance option.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

MBR Services can help significantly reduce members’ medical bills. Telemedicine and Prescription Savings are standard features.

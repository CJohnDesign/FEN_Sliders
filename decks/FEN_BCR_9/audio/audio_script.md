Let's begin by discussing the Basic Core Overview. This plan introduces members through an indemnity insurance model. 

Indemnity insurance means members can access healthcare services and then submit claims for reimbursement. 

One of the significant advantages is that there is no waiting period or exclusion period, making it accessible immediately upon enrollment. 

However, it's important to note that there is no coverage for pregnancy under this plan. 

Additionally, there are managed care options available to help guide members in their healthcare journey. 

Finally, we'll compare the Basic Core and Core Plus options to highlight the differences and benefits of each.

The Basic Core plan provides specific coverage options across various services.

Hospital services are a key feature, including hospital admission with five hundred dollars per day covered for a maximum of one day. Also, hospital daily confinement is covered at one hundred dollars per day for up to ten days.

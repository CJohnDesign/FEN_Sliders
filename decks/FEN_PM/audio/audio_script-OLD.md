Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Paramount Plan. We'll walk through the plan's comprehensive benefits. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to the Paramount Plan ----

The Paramount Plan provides flexible coverage for various medical situations. It combines hospital indemnity benefits with extensive support tools to help members navigate their healthcare journey. Membership is available through the Business Workers of America, which we'll refer to as BWA from now on, granting access to these exclusive benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let's explore the key features. Hospital Admission Benefits provide financial support when members are admitted to a hospital. Intensive Care Unit, or ICU, Confinement Benefits add protection for intensive care stays. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement Benefits extend coverage for multiple days. Some plans include Surgical and Ambulance Benefits for comprehensive protection. Members can also access Prescription Savings Programs through HealthWarehouse to help save on medications.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Medical Bill Repricing, which we'll call MBR, negotiates hospital and medical bills on behalf of members, lowering out-of-pocket expenses. A Reference-Based Pricing System ensures fair and competitive rates from healthcare providers. Financial Assistance Guidance helps members handle billing issues and navigate the payment process.

---- How the Plan Works ----

The process is straightforward. Members enroll through BWA and seek healthcare services as needed. Medical bills are submitted to MBR, and after negotiation, members receive an Explanation of Benefits, or EOB. The final step is paying the reduced balance, making the process simple while providing valuable cost savings.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Annual Wellness Exams help detect health issues early. Preventive Screenings address potential risks before they become serious. DirectLabs makes it convenient for members to obtain recommended lab tests without hassle.

---- Telehealth Services ----

Members have access to healthcare providers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through Virtual Doctor Visits, avoiding inconvenient clinic appointments. There are no consultation fees, meaning members can consult a doctor as often as needed. This service is both convenient and efficient, and can also provide necessary prescriptions.

---- Advocacy and Support Services ----

The plan includes concierge-style healthcare advocacy to guide members through provider selection and explain plan benefits. There's support for finding financial assistance options when needed. Additionally, we offer help throughout the claims process to reduce confusion and stress.

---- Paramount 1 Plan (1/2) ----

Let's look at our first plan option. This plan offers a First Day Hospital Confinement payment of $1,000, plus a separate $200 first-day benefit for ICU. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement coverage of $300 continues beyond the first day. There's a $200 Emergency Room Treatment benefit and coverage for Chiropractic Visits at $25, Doctor's Office Visits at $75, and Urgent Care at $150. Air and Ground Ambulance benefits of $300 and $100 respectively are included, along with a $50 annual Wellness Visit allowance.

---- Paramount 1 Plan (2/2) ----

Important to note: Pre-Existing Condition Limitations apply for the first 12 months. Normal Pregnancy Coverage is included, with no waiting period. However, Portability is not provided for this plan. There's no Annual Benefit Maximum, and no Benefit Waiting Period beyond enrollment. Benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- Paramount 2 Plan (1/2) ----

Moving to our second option, the first-day benefits for Hospital Confinement remain at $1,000, and ICU Confinement stays at $200. The ICU benefit from Day 2 forward increases to $500. There's coverage for Emergency Room Treatment at $200, Doctor's Office Visits at $50, and Urgent Care visits at $125. Air Ambulance at $200, Ground Ambulance at $100, and a $50 annual Wellness Visit are also included.

---- Paramount 2 Plan (2/2) ----

The same Pre-Existing Condition Limitations remain in place for 12 months. Normal Pregnancy Coverage is included without a waiting period. Like Plan 1, Portability is not offered, and there is no Annual Benefit Maximum. No Benefit Waiting Period is required, and benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- Paramount 3 Plan (1/2) ----

Our most comprehensive option includes first-day Hospital Confinement at $1,000 and ICU Confinement at $200, with $300 daily coverage for both afterward. Inpatient Surgery is covered at $1,500, and Outpatient Surgery comes with a $500 benefit. Emergency Room Treatment remains at $200, with Chiropractic Visits at $25, Doctor's Office Visits at $75, and Urgent Care at $150. Air Ambulance coverage increases to $300.

---- Paramount 3 Plan (2/2) ----

The Pre-Existing Condition Limitations remain consistent with a 12-month waiting period. Normal Pregnancy Coverage applies without a waiting period. There is no Portability and no Annual Benefit Maximum. No Benefit Waiting Period is required, and benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- Comparing the 3 Paramount Plans ----

Let's compare these plans side by side. Plan 1 includes Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement benefits but excludes Inpatient Surgery, Outpatient Surgery, or enhanced Air Ambulance coverage. Plan 2 adds a higher ICU daily rate of $500 and introduces Inpatient Surgery benefits at $1,500. Plan 3 offers the most comprehensive coverage, including both Inpatient Surgery at $1,500 and Outpatient Surgery at $500, along with enhanced Air Ambulance coverage at $300.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

Remember these important points: MBR Services can significantly reduce members' medical bills. Telemedicine and Prescription Savings are standard features across all plans. Preventive Care and Wellness benefits are designed to keep members healthier in the long run. And don't forget that BWA membership is required to access these plan benefits.

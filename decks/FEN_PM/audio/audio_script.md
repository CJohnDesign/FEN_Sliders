Hello, everyone! Welcome to our Paramount Plan training. Today, we're going to walk through the key features and benefits of the Paramount Plan, and how you can effectively present it to your clients. Let's get started!

---- Introduction & General Information ----

The Paramount Plan is a flexible health coverage solution designed to meet a variety of needs. It’s offered through the **Business Workers of America (BWA)**, giving members exclusive access to a range of benefits.

Now, think of this plan as a toolbox for healthcare. It helps members access necessary services while keeping their costs under control. Our goal today is to make sure you feel confident explaining this plan to your clients and helping them choose the right level of coverage.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let’s start by discussing some key features of the Paramount Plan.

First, there are **hospital admission benefits** that provide financial support when a member is admitted to the hospital. Depending on the plan level, members will also have **ICU confinement benefits** and **daily hospital confinement benefits** for extended stays. These are essential safety nets for anyone facing an unexpected hospitalization.

There are also **surgical and ambulance benefits** included in some plans. And all Paramount Plans come with a **Prescription Savings Program** through HealthWarehouse. This isn’t a full prescription plan, but it offers discounts that can significantly reduce medication costs.

These features ensure that members are supported across various healthcare scenarios.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

One of the most valuable aspects of the Paramount Plan is its focus on cost management. Let’s talk about how the plan helps members control their expenses.

The first tool is **Medical Bill Repricing (MBR)**. This service negotiates directly with providers to reduce the cost of medical bills. It’s especially helpful for members facing large hospital bills.

Next, there’s **Reference-Based Pricing**, which ensures members are getting fair, competitive rates from providers. And if a member finds themselves overwhelmed by the billing process, **Financial Assistance Guidance** is available to help them navigate claims and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

---- How the Plan Works ----

Here’s a quick breakdown of how the Paramount Plan works in practice:

First, a member enrolls through BWA. Once they’re enrolled, they can access healthcare services and submit their bills for repricing through MBR. After their bill is negotiated, they’ll receive an **Explanation of Benefits (EOB)** that outlines the adjusted costs. The final step is paying the balance based on those negotiated rates. It’s a streamlined process that helps members save money without navigating complex systems alone.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Let’s talk about preventive care. One of the best ways to manage healthcare costs is to stay healthy in the first place, and the Paramount Plan supports that.

Members receive **annual wellness exams** and **preventive screenings** to catch potential issues early. These services are often the first line of defense in preventing serious health conditions.

The plan also partners with **DirectLabs** to provide direct access to lab services, making it easy for members to get the tests they need without the usual hassles.

---- Virtual Healthcare Services ----

Next, let’s discuss virtual healthcare services, which are a key part of the Paramount Plan.

Members have 24/7 access to **telemedicine**, allowing them to consult with a doctor anytime, from anywhere. This is a huge convenience, especially for busy individuals who might not have time to visit a clinic.

There’s also a **Health Hotline**, where members can speak to a nurse at any time. This service provides quick advice and can help members decide whether they need further medical attention.

Lastly, the plan offers **Prescription Discounts** for both brand-name and generic medications, helping members save on their prescriptions.

---- Advocacy and Support Services ----

Navigating the healthcare system can be overwhelming. That’s why the Paramount Plan includes **advocacy and support services** to assist members every step of the way.

Members have access to **concierge-style healthcare advocacy**, which can help them find specialists, understand their bills, or even access financial assistance programs.

These advocacy services are especially valuable when members face more complex healthcare situations and need a little extra help to make the right decisions.

---- Paramount 1 Plan Overview ----

Now, let’s take a look at the first level of coverage: the **Paramount 1 Plan**.

This plan provides essential hospital indemnity coverage. Members receive a **$1,000 hospital admission benefit** for the first day of hospitalization. They also have a **daily hospital confinement benefit** of $100 per day to help cover extended stays. And if they visit the emergency room, there’s a **$200 benefit per visit**.

This plan is great for clients looking for basic hospital coverage without too many additional benefits.

---- Paramount 2 Plan Overview ----

The **Paramount 2 Plan** builds on the first plan with more robust coverage.

In addition to the hospital admission benefit, it offers a **$500 ICU confinement benefit per day**. This can be a critical resource for clients who may face more serious health conditions requiring intensive care.

It also includes **surgical benefits** of up to $1,500 for inpatient procedures, and **ambulance coverage** to help with transportation costs during emergencies.

This plan is a solid choice for clients who want a bit more peace of mind and comprehensive hospital coverage.

---- Paramount 3 Plan Overview ----

Finally, we have the **Paramount 3 Plan**, the most comprehensive option.

This plan offers the same **$1,000 hospital admission benefit** and **$300 ICU confinement benefit per day**, but it also includes an **air ambulance benefit** of $300 per transport. For clients who live in rural areas or travel often, this could be a game-changer.

Additionally, the plan covers **outpatient surgeries** with a benefit of up to $500.

This plan is ideal for clients seeking maximum flexibility and protection across a wide range of medical scenarios.

---- Comparing the Plans ----

Let’s briefly compare these three plans in practical terms.

The **Paramount 1 Plan** provides basic hospital coverage. It’s a good fit for clients who want essential protection without too many extras.

The **Paramount 2 Plan** steps up the benefits with ICU coverage and surgical benefits, making it more suitable for clients with a higher risk of serious health events.

And the **Paramount 3 Plan** offers the broadest coverage, including air ambulance and outpatient surgery benefits, for those who want comprehensive protection.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

Before we wrap up, let’s review a few key points to remember:

- **Medical Bill Repricing (MBR)** can significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs.
- **Telemedicine and prescription discounts** are included across all plans.
- **Preventive care** is an essential part of the plan, promoting long-term health.
- And finally, **BWA membership** is required to access these benefits.

Make sure you’re communicating these points clearly to your clients, and always ensure they understand what their plan covers and how to use it.

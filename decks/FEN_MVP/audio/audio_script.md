---- Cover ----

Hello everyone! Thank you for joining today's training session on MedValue+. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to MedValue+ ----

MedValue+, sponsored by HC Data Consulting LLC, 

is a high-deductible ERISA plan that provides Minimal Essential Coverage, also known as MEC, along with professional services benefits.

When presenting to prospects, emphasize that this plan combines essential health coverage with practical benefits designed for budget-conscious individuals and families.

The plan exclusively uses the First Health Network for all covered services. The First Health Network achieves outstanding results with wide-ranging access and provider availability, flexible repricing solutions, and outstanding customer service that consistently supports members and providers.

---- Age Eligibility & Plan Options ----

Let's cover eligibility and the plan options available.

Adult members are eligible from ages 18 through 64. Dependent children can be covered from ages 1 through 25.

MedValue+ offers three plan levels to meet different budgets: MedValue 2000 Plus with a two thousand dollar individual deductible and four thousand dollar family deductible, MedValue 4000 Plus with a four thousand dollar individual deductible and eight thousand dollar family deductible, and MedValue 6000 Plus with a six thousand dollar individual deductible and twelve thousand dollar family deductible.

It's important to explain to prospects that all plans only cover in-network services through the First Health Network.

---- Knockout Questions ----

As agents, you need to understand the knockout questions that will result in application denial. Applicants cannot enroll if they answer yes to any of these questions:

Are you currently confined to a hospital, nursing home, or other medical facility?

Have you been diagnosed with or treated for AIDS, HIV, or ARC?

Are you currently receiving or have been recommended to receive dialysis treatment?

Have you been diagnosed with or treated for any form of cancer, other than basal cell skin cancer, in the past 5 years?

Are you currently pregnant or awaiting the results of a pregnancy test?

Have you been diagnosed with or treated for organ failure requiring transplant?

These are summarized versions of the knockout questions. The full version will be included in the enrollment process. Make sure your prospects understand that answering yes to any knockout question will disqualify them from enrollment.

---- Plan Highlights ----

Here are the key highlights you'll want to emphasize when presenting MedValue Plus.

Preventive Care is covered at zero dollars copay. This includes annual physicals, screenings, and immunizations as outlined in the Preventive Care Guide.

Telemedicine visits are unlimited at zero dollars copay, giving members convenient access to virtual doctor visits.

Preventive Generic Prescriptions are covered at zero dollars, subject to the formulary.

Med Defender Pro is included with all plans, providing medical bill negotiation services and patient assistance program navigation.

Discount benefits through Compass DVH provide savings on dental, vision, prescriptions, and hearing services.

Members have direct access to specialists with no referral needed.

---- Deductibles & Out-of-Pocket Maximums ----

Let's review the deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for each plan level.

Remember that all plans only cover in-network services through the First Health Network.

Individual deductibles range from two thousand dollars on MedValue 2000 Plus up to six thousand dollars on MedValue 6000 Plus. Family deductibles are double the individual amount.

The out-of-pocket maximum is the same across all three plans: ninety-two hundred dollars for individuals and eighteen thousand four hundred dollars for families. This includes the member's accumulated deductible and copays.

It's important to note that out-of-pocket expenses for services beyond plan limits are unlimited.

---- Office Visits & Telemedicine ----

Now let's explain the office visit structure, which is important for your prospects to understand.

Members get 4 office visits per benefit period maximum, and this is combined across PCP visits, specialist visits, and urgent care visits. Two visits are available before the deductible is met, and two visits after.

PCP office visits have a fifty dollar copay.

Specialist office visits also have a fifty dollar copay, but this is after the deductible is met. The good news is that no referral is needed for specialist visits. Urgent care visits have a fifty dollar copay after deductible.

Telemedicine is a major benefit. Members get unlimited virtual doctor visits at zero dollars copay, making healthcare accessible without the need to visit a provider in person.

---- Labs & Diagnostics ----

Let's cover the diagnostic testing benefits.

Lab work has a twenty-five dollar copay after deductible, with a maximum of 3 visits per benefit year.

X-rays have a fifty dollar copay after deductible, also limited to 3 visits per benefit year.

Advanced Imaging, which includes CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans, has a four hundred dollar copay after deductible, limited to 3 visits per benefit year. Make sure to explain that pre-certification is required for diagnostic testing and advanced imaging.

Now let's discuss emergency room benefits.

Emergency Room visits have a five hundred dollar copay after the deductible is met, with a maximum of 1 visit per benefit year. Emergency Room Services also have a five hundred dollar copay after deductible, limited to 1 per benefit year.

It's critical to explain that pre-certification is required within 48 hours of admission if the member is admitted to the hospital following an emergency room visit.

Standard Generic medications are covered at zero dollars copay after the deductible is met, also subject to formulary. It's very important to explain that there is no coverage for brand-name or specialty medications. Only generic medications are covered under the prescription benefit.

---- Med Defender Pro ----

Med Defender Pro is included with all MedValue Plus plans.

The Medical Bill Negotiator service works on behalf of your members to negotiate unexpected medical costs.

This helps reduce out-of-pocket expenses for both covered and non-covered services, using professional advocates experienced in medical billing.

The Patient Assistance Program helps navigate patient assistance programs available in the member's area. This connects members with manufacturer programs and charitable assistance, subject to availability in their location.

These services help members manage healthcare expenses beyond their plan benefits.

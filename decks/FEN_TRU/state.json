      "summary": "This page outlines the exclusions and limitations associated with the MEC/Preventive Health Services plan. It specifies that any claims for services received outside the United States are excluded, except for those covered by the Veterans Administration or Department of Defense. Claims for services not deemed medically necessary or not contracted within a PPO network are also excluded. The plan does not cover charges reimbursed by public health programs or claims due to acts of war or terrorism. Additionally, claims for eyeglasses, hearing aids, and abortion services are not covered unless specified in the schedule of benefits.\n\nThe document further excludes claims for custodial care, experimental treatments, and services related to suicide or illegal acts. Claims from medical service providers related by blood or marriage to the participant are not covered. Fertility treatments, weight control surgeries, and sterilization reversal are also excluded. The plan does not cover claims for missed appointments, genetic testing, or organ transplants unless explicitly included in the benefits schedule.\n\nOther exclusions include chiropractic care, radiation therapy, dialysis, acupuncture, and alternative medicine. The plan does not cover non-emergency care outside the U.S., pregnancy benefits, or routine well-baby care while inpatient. The purpose of these exclusions is to clarify treatments and services not covered under this plan, ensuring no negative implications are assumed regarding coverage.",

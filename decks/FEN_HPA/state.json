Legal actions to recover benefits must be initiated within 60 days after proof of loss is furnished, and no action can be taken after three years from the time proof is required. The policy allows for physical examinations and autopsies at the company's expense when a claim is pending. \n\nProof of loss must be submitted within 90 days, and the company reserves the right to deny claims if proof is not provided within a year unless the claimant is incapacitated. Subrogation rights are detailed, allowing the company to recover benefits paid if the insured is compensated by a third party. The insured must cooperate fully in these recovery efforts. \n\nThe policy also addresses recovery of overpayments, allowing the company to request a lump sum repayment or reduce future payments. There is an 18-month period to recover overpayments from healthcare providers and a 12-month period for recovery from claimants, with exceptions for fraud or misrepresentation. In the event of the insured's death, overpayments may be recovered from the estate.",

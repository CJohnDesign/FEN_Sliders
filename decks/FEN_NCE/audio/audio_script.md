Hello, everyone! Welcome to our presentation on the National Congress of Employers. Today, we'll explore what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits NCE offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Associations are organizations formed 

to serve the collective interests of their members, 

often by providing access to various services, 

including health insurance plans.

---- How Associations Work ----

An association

negotiates group rates 

by leveraging the collective power of its members.

It offers better terms and coverage 

by acting as an intermediary between insurance providers and members.

The association manages the enrollment process 

and provides ongoing member support.

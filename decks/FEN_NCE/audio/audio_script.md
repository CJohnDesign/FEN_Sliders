Hello, everyone! Welcome to our presentation on the National Congress of Employers. As you can see on the title slide, we're focused on supporting America's independent workforce. Today, we'll explore what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits NCE offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Associations are organizations formed to serve the collective interests of their members, often by providing access to various services, including health insurance plans.

---- How Associations Work ----

Role: As an association negotiates and offers health insurance plans and other benefits to its member businesses or employees. The association's role is to leverage the collective purchasing power of its members to obtain better terms and coverage.

Structure: The association acts as an intermediary between insurance providers and its members. It negotiates group rates and terms, manages enrollment, and provides support for its members.

---- Who is NCE? ----

The National Congress of Employers (NCE) is a prominent organization dedicated to supporting the nation's 56.7 million independent workers, including micro-businesses and self-employed individuals. Established in 1996 by attorneys, former politicians, and business leaders, NCE focuses on advocating for the interests of its members through policy advocacy and providing valuable resources.

Mission and Purpose: The National Congress of Employers (NCE) is dedicated to supporting micro-businesses and independent workers by providing reliable services, resources, and benefits, regardless of individual circumstances or means.

Value to Members: NCE provides its members with reliable services, resources, and benefits, regardless of individual circumstances or means. This commitment empowers members by offering valuable tools and support to enhance their professional success and personal well-being.

---- NCE & Plan Relationship ----

Prior to discussing plan benefit information, clients must be informed of this information. Members must be working and become a Member of the NCE Group to be eligible for plan and Member Benefits. This allows Members to not only take advantage of NCE Membership Benefits but Health Benefits as well.

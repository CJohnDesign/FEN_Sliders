Hello, everyone! Welcome to our presentation on the National Congress of Employers. As you can see on the title slide, we're focused on supporting America's independent workforce. Today, we'll explore what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits NCE offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Looking at our first topic, let's understand what an Association is. As shown on the slide, Associations are organizations formed to serve the collective interests of their members. They provide access to various services, with a particular focus on health insurance plans. The key strength lies in leveraging collective purchasing power to negotiate better terms and coverage for all members.

---- How Associations Work ----

On this slide, we can see the key operational aspects of associations. As an association, NCE acts as an intermediary, negotiating and offering health insurance plans and other benefits to member businesses and employees. We manage the enrollment process, provide ongoing member support, and leverage our collective power to obtain better terms and coverage.

---- Who is NCE? ----

As highlighted on this slide, the National Congress of Employers, or NCE, is a prominent organization dedicated to supporting the nation's 56.7 million independent workers. Established in 1996 by attorneys, former politicians, and business leaders, we focus on policy advocacy and providing valuable resources. Our mission is to support micro-businesses and independent workers with reliable services and benefits, regardless of individual circumstances.

---- NCE & Plan Relationship ----

Looking at this important relationship slide, there's something crucial you need to understand about membership. As shown here, members must be working and become a Member of the NCE Group to be eligible for plan and Member Benefits. This membership opens the door to both NCE Membership Benefits and comprehensive Health Benefits.

---- GapAfford Plus Benefits ----

Now, let's explore the GapAfford Plus Program shown on this slide. This is an excellent way for individuals and families to save money on out-of-pocket medical expenses. As you can see, there are no deductibles, medical exams, claim forms, usage limitations, age restrictions, or pre-existing condition limitations. Through the First Health Network, members enjoy provider network discounts nationwide.

---- Additional Member Benefits ----

As displayed in these three benefit categories, NCE offers valuable additional benefits. Under Healthcare Savings, the Prescription Discount Benefit saves 15-55% on medications, while Aetna Dental AccessÂ® provides 15-50% savings at over 132,000 locations. For Specialty Care, we offer chiropractic services and lab work. And in our Extra Value category, members receive discounts on pet prescriptions, vitamins, and supplements, all with nationwide coverage.

---- Closing ----

Thank you for taking the time to learn about the National Congress of Employers and our comprehensive member benefits. As our closing slide emphasizes, we're dedicated to supporting America's independent workforce.

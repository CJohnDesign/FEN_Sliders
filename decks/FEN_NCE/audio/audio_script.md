Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the National Congress of Employers. We'll explore what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits NCE offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Let's begin with understanding what an Association is. Associations are organizations formed to serve the collective interests of their members, often by providing access to various services, including health insurance plans.

---- How Associations Work ----

Now, let me explain how Associations operate. As an association, NCE negotiates and offers health insurance plans and other benefits to its member businesses or employees. The association's role is to leverage the collective purchasing power of its members to obtain better terms and coverage. The association acts as an intermediary between insurance providers and its members, negotiating group rates and terms, managing enrollment, and providing ongoing support.

---- Who is NCE? ----

The National Congress of Employers, or NCE, is a prominent organization dedicated to supporting the nation's 56.7 million independent workers, including micro-businesses and self-employed individuals. Established in 1996 by attorneys, former politicians, and business leaders, NCE focuses on advocating for the interests of its members through policy advocacy and providing valuable resources. Their mission is to support micro-businesses and independent workers by providing reliable services, resources, and benefits, regardless of individual circumstances or means.

---- NCE & Plan Relationship ----

Before we dive into plan benefit information, there's something important you need to understand. Members must be working and become a Member of the NCE Group to be eligible for plan and Member Benefits. This allows Members to not only take advantage of NCE Membership Benefits but Health Benefits as well.

---- GapAfford Plus Benefits ----

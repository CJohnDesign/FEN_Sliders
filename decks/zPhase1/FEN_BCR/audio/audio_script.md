Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Basic Core health insurance plans.

We'll walk through the plan's coverage options and features.

Let's get started!

---- Core Benefits Overview ----

The Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus plans offer health insurance coverage underwritten by the American Public Life Insurance Company, with an A plus (Superior) rating from AM Best.

These plans are designed to provide essential health benefits without waiting periods or exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

However, they do not cover pregnancy.

Let's explore the key features and benefits of these plans.

The plans cover hospital admission and confinement costs, providing six hundred dollars per day for hospital admission, capped at one day.

They also offer one hundred dollars per day for hospital daily confinement, up to ten days.

Emergency and urgent care benefits include coverage for emergency room visits at one hundred dollars per day for one day.

Urgent care visits are covered at fifty dollars per day for up to three days.

Additionally, physician office visits are covered at seventy dollars per day for up to three days.

The Free Prescription Club is a valuable feature, offering free acute and chronic medications, diabetic supplies, and pharmacy coaching.

Members also have access to a personal portal for account management.

They can benefit from discounted diabetic insulin through Walmart and reduced prices for over-the-counter medications.

Telemedicine services provide unlimited virtual doctor visits available twenty-four/seven under the Basic Core-Plus plan.

Consultations are available via various digital platforms with immediate prescription filling.

The Medical Bill Repricer Services allow members to visit any doctor with set prepay amounts for visits, twenty-five dollars for primary care, and fifty dollars for specialists.

Reference Based Pricing helps manage healthcare costs by paying providers a percentage of Medicare Allowable Rates, ranging from one hundred fifty percent to two hundred percent.

Advocacy services include a concierge service to assist members in understanding their benefits, filing claims, and negotiating with providers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Cost management tools are embedded within the plans.

Notably, through the Medical Bill Repricer Services and advocacy offerings that facilitate efficient healthcare cost navigation.

---- How Medical Bill Repricer Works ----

The Medical Bill Repricer, or MBR, empowers members to choose any healthcare provider.

Basic Core-Plus offers additional features, such as unlimited virtual doctor visits without copay and free generic medications.

Both plans include the Free Prescription Club, but Basic Core-Plus enhances medication benefits significantly.

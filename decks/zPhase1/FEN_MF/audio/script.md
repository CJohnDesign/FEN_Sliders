**---- Cover ----**

Thank you for joining us at FirstEnroll Education & Development. Today, we’re going to be reviewing our Paramount Plans. These are Hospital Indemnity Plans designed to provide set benefit amounts for various covered services, offering members predictability and support in managing their healthcare expenses.

**---- Introduction & General Information ----**

The Paramount Plans pay fixed daily benefit amounts for approved hospital confinements and certain medical services. Instead of dealing with traditional deductibles or coinsurance, members receive a specified payment amount for each covered event. This structure helps members plan and understand what to expect when they access healthcare services.

Each plan offers a first-day confinement benefit for both Hospital and ICU stays, along with coverage for additional days in the hospital. Additional outpatient benefits, such as Emergency Room visits and Doctor’s office visits, may vary by plan. Some plans even include specialized benefits like inpatient and outpatient surgery coverage.

**---- Key Common Points ----**

Before we look at each plan individually, let’s review some key features shared across the Paramount Plans.

All Paramount Plans are Hospital Indemnity Plans, meaning members receive set benefit amounts for covered events. Each plan includes a First Day Hospital Confinement benefit of $1,000 and a First Day ICU Confinement benefit of $200. These first-day benefits are payable once per year, and hospital or ICU confinement from Day 2 onward is covered up to 10 days per year. Remember, the first day confinement is separate and not counted toward the 10 covered days.

Pre-existing conditions are not covered for the first 12 months, and although there is no general waiting period for other benefits, those aged 70 and older will see their benefits reduced by 75%. Normal Pregnancy coverage is included with no additional waiting period, and complications of pregnancy are always covered.

When it comes to outpatient benefits, if multiple services occur on the same day (such as visiting a Doctor’s office and a Chiropractor), only the highest applicable benefit will pay. Members are encouraged to work with MBR Plus to help minimize their healthcare costs and to call MBR before visiting providers for guidance.

Additionally, each Paramount Plan is associated with the Business Workers of America (B.W.A.), offering members access to potential discounts and benefits beyond the plan’s core hospital indemnity coverage. The exact discounts and benefits may vary, so it’s important to familiarize yourself with each plan’s details.

**---- Required Verbiage & Disclosures ----**

As you review these benefits, be sure to communicate any important disclosures, footnotes, and limitations to the client. Make certain they understand the pre-existing condition waiting period, the age-based reduction of benefits, and any restrictions on when and where benefits apply. Complete and compliant communication is essential.

**---- Paramount 1 Plan ----**

Thank you for joining us as we detail the Paramount 1 Plan. This plan serves as our foundational Hospital Indemnity option, providing essential coverage levels.

Under the Paramount 1 Plan, members receive a First Day Hospital Confinement benefit of $1,000 and a First Day ICU Confinement benefit of $200, each payable once per year. From Day 2 onward, Hospital Confinement pays $100 per day, and ICU Confinement pays $200 per day, both up to 10 days per year.

This plan also provides several outpatient benefits. Emergency Room Treatment is covered for up to 1 day per year at $200. Chiropractic Visits can be reimbursed for up to 5 days per year at $25 per day. Doctor’s office visits are covered up to 3 days per year at $50 per day. Urgent Care visits are covered for up to 2 days per year with a $125 benefit per visit.

Ambulance services, whether by Air, Ground, or Water, are covered up to 1 day per year with a $100 benefit amount. The Wellness benefit offers $50 for 1 day per year, encouraging preventive and proactive care.

Remember, pre-existing conditions are not payable during the first 12 months. There is no general waiting period for these benefits, but if the insured is 70 or older, benefits reduce by 75%. Normal Pregnancy is included, and complications of pregnancy are always covered.

It’s important to note that benefits for Confinement will not pay if treatment occurs in an Emergency Room, as an Outpatient, in an Observation Unit, or for hospital stays under 20 hours. Additionally, if the member is discharged and readmitted for the same or related condition within 30 days, benefits will not pay.

For Outpatient services on the same day, only the highest applicable benefit will be paid. For example, if a member has both a Doctor’s visit ($50) and a Chiropractor visit ($25) on the same day, only the $50 Doctor’s visit benefit would be payable.

Finally, encourage members to use MBR Plus for cost management and to reach out to MBR before visiting providers. Also, remind them that as members of B.W.A., they may have access to additional benefits and discounts.

**---- Paramount 2 Plan ----**

Now, let’s move on to the Paramount 2 Plan. This plan builds on the Paramount 1 Plan with enhanced daily benefits.

Like the first plan, the Paramount 2 Plan offers a First Day Hospital Confinement benefit of $1,000 and a First Day ICU Confinement benefit of $200 once per year. From Day 2 onward, the Hospital Confinement benefit increases to $300 per day, and ICU Confinement jumps to $500 per day, each up to 10 days per year. These enhanced amounts can provide a higher level of financial support during a hospital stay.

The outpatient benefits remain robust. The Emergency Room Treatment pays $200 for 1 day per year. Chiropractic Visits are still $25 per day for up to 5 days per year. Doctor’s offices remain covered for up to 3 days per year at $50 each, and Urgent Care at $125 per day up to 2 days per year.

For Ambulance services, this plan provides a $100 benefit for Ground or Water transport and a $200 benefit for Air transport, payable up to 1 day per year. The Wellness benefit remains $50, once per year.

Pre-existing conditions are not payable for the first 12 months of coverage. Normal Pregnancy and complications of pregnancy are covered, and there is no normal pregnancy waiting period. Benefits for those 70 and older are reduced by 75%.

All prior rules apply regarding confinement limitations, outpatient day-of-service benefit conflicts, and the importance of consulting MBR Plus. Remind clients they are part of the B.W.A. association and may access member benefits and discounts.

**---- Paramount 3 Plan ----**

Now, let’s review the Paramount 3 Plan, which offers even more coverage and includes surgical benefits.

Similar to the previous plans, the Paramount 3 Plan provides a $1,000 first-day Hospital Confinement benefit and a $200 first-day ICU Confinement benefit once per year. For subsequent days, both Hospital and ICU Confinements are covered at $300 per day, up to 10 days per year.

What sets this plan apart is the inclusion of surgery benefits. Inpatient Surgery is covered at $1,500, and Outpatient Surgery performed in a Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center is covered at $500.

The outpatient benefits continue with a $200 Emergency Room benefit for 1 day per year, Doctor’s office visits at $75 per day for up to 3 days per year, and Urgent Care at $150 per day for up to 2 days per year. Ambulance coverage now provides $300 for Air transport and $100 for Ground or Water, up to 1 day per year.

A Wellness benefit of $50 for 1 day per year helps encourage preventive care. As with all Paramount Plans, pre-existing conditions are not payable for the first 12 months. Normal Pregnancy and its complications are covered, and there is no normal pregnancy waiting period. Those aged 70 and older have benefits reduced by 75%.

All limitations on confinement, outpatient service coordination, and use of MBR Plus remain the same. Remind members that B.W.A. membership could provide additional benefits and discounts.

**---- Closing Reminders ----**

As we conclude, let’s review a few essential points. Pre-existing conditions are not payable for the first 12 months across all Paramount Plans. For individuals aged 70 and older, benefits are reduced by 75%. If multiple outpatient services occur on the same day, only the highest applicable benefit is payable. Members should always be encouraged to utilize MBR Plus for cost management and to reach out before visiting providers.

The B.W.A. association can offer further benefits and discounts, so ensure clients are aware of these opportunities. Above all, remember to communicate these benefits, limitations, and exclusions thoroughly and compliantly, always placing the member’s understanding and care first.

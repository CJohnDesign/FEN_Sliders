The plan is particularly useful for managing costs such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, providing fixed payments to alleviate financial stress during recovery from accidents or illnesses. \n\nThe document outlines how indemnity insurance supplements existing coverage by offering cash benefits, with an illustrative example of a 35-year-old woman who could receive a total benefit of $3,175 from various components like hospital admission and physician office visits. This flexibility allows clients to use the funds for a range of expenses, including medical costs, transportation, and childcare, highlighting the autonomy and financial relief provided by the plan.\n\nAdditionally, the page lists compelling reasons to choose Everest Group Indemnity Insurance, such as access to the Multiplan PPO Network, direct benefit payments to clients, and a simplified claims process ensuring quick payouts. However, it also includes a disclaimer noting that benefit payouts are estimates and subject to policy-specific terms, conditions, and exclusions, clarifying that this insurance is not a substitute for major medical coverage.",

  "processed_summaries": "## page_01\n\nThis page provides an introductory overview of a specific insurance product offered by Everest Reinsurance Company, facilitated through NCE. The insurance type is identified as 'Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance,' which typically offers a set payout for designated services, independent of the actual costs incurred. This structure is particularly advantageous for managing routine medical expenses. The plan incorporates the Multiplan PPO Network, which allows for flexibility in selecting healthcare providers and generally offers enhanced coverage for services provided by in-network providers. The visual theme of the slide, featuring an image of two individuals walking on a beach, underscores themes of care, support, and well-being, aligning with the insurance's objective of providing financial protection related to health. The slide is specifically intended for insurance agents, as indicated by the 'For Agent Use Only' note, suggesting its role in training or informing agents about the insurance plan. However, the slide does not delve into specific benefits, limitations, or exclusions, which are essential for a thorough understanding of the insurance offering.\n\n\n## page_02\n\nThis page introduces the Everest Group Indemnity Insurance, emphasizing its role as a supplementary insurance plan designed to cover unexpected medical expenses that are not fully covered by primary insurance. The plan is particularly useful for managing costs such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, providing fixed payments to alleviate financial stress during recovery from accidents or illnesses. \n\nThe document outlines how indemnity insurance supplements existing coverage by offering cash benefits, with an illustrative example of a 35-year-old woman who could receive a total benefit of $3,175 from various components like hospital admission and physician office visits. This flexibility allows clients to use the funds for a range of expenses, including medical costs, transportation, and childcare, highlighting the autonomy and financial relief provided by the plan.\n\nAdditionally, the page lists compelling reasons to choose Everest Group Indemnity Insurance, such as access to the Multiplan PPO Network, direct benefit payments to clients, and a simplified claims process ensuring quick payouts. However, it also includes a disclaimer noting that benefit payouts are estimates and subject to policy-specific terms, conditions, and exclusions, clarifying that this insurance is not a substitute for major medical coverage.\n\n\n## page_03\n\nThis page provides an in-depth analysis of the Everest Group Fixed Indemnity Plan options, specifically detailing Plan 100, Plan 200, Plan 200+, and Plan 300. Each plan is designed to offer varying levels of benefits and coverage, tailored to meet different needs and circumstances. The plans are structured with specific limitations and conditions, which are crucial for potential policyholders to understand.\n\nThe plans feature a '12-12 Pre-Existing Conditions' limitation, imposing a 12-month waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions. Despite this, all plans are 'Guaranteed Issue,' ensuring that eligibility is not contingent upon the applicant's health status. Confinement benefits are a significant component, with hospital confinement benefits ranging from $100 to $300 per day, depending on the plan. ICU confinement benefits are similarly structured, with coverage available for up to 30 days per confinement and 90 days per certificate year.\n\nHospital benefits include coverage for emergency room visits, limited to two visits per certificate year with a $50 benefit per visit. Plans 200+ and 300 offer additional surgery benefits. Procedure benefits are available in the higher-tier plans, providing a combined inpatient and outpatient benefit. Outpatient benefits vary across plans, with coverage for lab work, X-rays, advanced diagnostics, and physician office visits. Limitations include exclusions for chiropractic and acupuncture services, with benefits subject to state-specific terms and conditions.\n\n\n## page_04\n\nThis page provides a detailed comparison of four group fixed indemnity plans offered by Everest, specifically Plan 500, Plan 750, Plan 1000, and Plan 1000+. Each plan is analyzed based on its benefits, coverage, and limitations. The plans are structured with a 'Guaranteed Issue' underwriting level, ensuring that applicants cannot be denied coverage due to health conditions. \n\nThe benefits include hospital and ICU confinement payments, with amounts increasing from Plan 500 to Plan 1000+. Emergency room visits are limited to two per certificate year, with reimbursement amounts varying by plan. Hospital admission benefits are notably higher in Plan 1000+, allowing for five admissions per certificate year. Surgical procedures are covered for up to three days per year, with daily reimbursement amounts increasing with higher-tier plans. Anesthesia costs are uniformly covered at 25% across all plans.\n\nOutpatient benefits cover X-rays, labs, advanced diagnostics, and physician office visits, with specific limits on the number of covered days or visits per year. Reimbursement amounts for these services also increase with higher-tier plans. However, the plans include a 12-month pre-existing condition limitation, and there is no coverage for chiropractic or acupuncture care. Benefits are provided on a per-person basis, and policy terms may vary by state.\n\n\n## page_05\n\nThis page provides an in-depth FAQ section for the Everest Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance, a supplemental health plan designed to offer fixed payments for specific covered medical expenses. The insurance is characterized by its fixed benefit structure, which is particularly beneficial for managing predictable healthcare costs. Members have access to a network of participating providers, where they can avail discounts by using a dedicated website or contacting a specified phone number. The plan includes coverage for advanced diagnostic tests such as angiograms, bone marrow tests, and MRIs, ensuring comprehensive diagnostic care.\n\nThe document clarifies the definitions of 'Calendar Year' and 'Certificate Year', with the former spanning from January 1st to December 31st, and the latter aligning with the plan year as indicated in the Certificate Schedule. A notable feature is the 'Free Look Period', which allows policyholders a 10-day window to return the certificate for any reason, providing flexibility and assurance to the insured.\n\nAdditionally, the page defines 'Confinement' as hospital admissions for inpatient services, with benefits calculated on a per-day basis. 'Diagnostic Care' is described as essential medical services for diagnosing conditions, including tests and biopsies. The MultiPlan PPO Network is highlighted as a valuable component, offering a broad range of provider options with discounted services, enhancing the plan's flexibility and accessibility.\n\n\n## page_06\n\nThis page provides a detailed examination of the exclusions and limitations inherent in the insurance plan, focusing on specific medical and non-medical services that are not covered. It is essential for policyholders to understand these exclusions to avoid unexpected expenses. The document specifies that coverage for breast surgery is limited to reconstruction following a medically necessary mastectomy due to cancer treatment, excluding procedures like capsular contraction, augmentation, or reduction mammoplasty unless related to cancer treatment. Services provided by individuals who do not typically charge for their services are not covered unless there is a legal obligation to do so.\n\nCosmetic surgery is generally excluded, except when reconstructive surgery is necessary due to trauma, infection, or congenital conditions affecting a dependent child. Dental care and treatment are also excluded unless related to accidental injury or congenital conditions affecting a dependent child's functional dental structure. Elective treatments or surgeries are not covered under the plan. Additionally, no benefits are extended for treatments considered experimental or investigational.\n\nThe plan excludes coverage for accidents resulting from participation in extreme sports such as skydiving and bungee jumping. Services rendered by family members are not eligible for benefits. Coverage for treatments outside the United States is excluded unless incurred during business or pleasure travel and in case of an emergency approved for use in the U.S., with a restriction of 30 days. This page serves as a critical reference for understanding the limitations of the insurance coverage.\n\n\n## page_07\n\nThis page provides an in-depth analysis of the exclusions present in an insurance policy, highlighting various scenarios where benefits are not payable. The exclusions cover a wide range of situations, ensuring policyholders are aware of the limitations of their coverage. Key exclusions include gender-related treatments, such as those for gender transformation or sexual function enhancement, which are not covered. Additionally, injuries sustained from hazardous activities, particularly those involving professional sports or occupations, are excluded from coverage.\n\nThe policy also excludes losses resulting from illegal acts or while the insured is incarcerated. Intoxication-related losses, especially those occurring while operating a vehicle, are not covered, with proof based on state laws and medical reports. Only medically necessary treatments are covered, excluding others. Mental illness and substance abuse-related losses are generally excluded unless specific benefits apply. Losses due to narcotics, unless prescribed, and conditions resulting from illegal substance overdose are also excluded.\n\nPregnancy-related services are not covered unless the life of the pregnant person is endangered, with some exceptions under specific benefits. Furthermore, losses incurred during active military service are not payable. This detailed guide is crucial for policyholders to understand the boundaries of their insurance coverage, helping them avoid unexpected financial burdens by recognizing these limitations.\n\n\n## page_08\n\nThis page provides a detailed overview of the exclusions and limitations associated with a health insurance policy. It highlights specific conditions, treatments, and activities that are not covered under the plan, ensuring that policyholders are fully informed of their coverage boundaries. The document begins by addressing exclusions related to the musculoskeletal system and acupuncture, specifying that treatments involving nerve interference or vertebral column misalignment are not covered. Additionally, it excludes coverage for Meridian therapy and acupuncture.\n\nThe policy also outlines exclusions related to sports activities, where injuries sustained during intercollegiate, interscholastic, or organized competitive sports are not covered. However, recreational community sports activities are not excluded. Furthermore, the policy does not cover losses resulting from suicide or intentional self-inflicted injuries, regardless of the intent behind them.\n\nAnother significant exclusion pertains to accidents involving an unlicensed driver, unless the driver holds a learner's permit and is under instruction. Losses due to war, riots, insurrections, or armed forces service are also not covered, although terrorism-related losses are not excluded. The policy excludes benefits for weight-related treatments, including surgeries and counseling for weight control and obesity.\n\nCoverage is also denied for conditions that are eligible under workers' compensation laws, even if no claim is filed. Pre-existing conditions are excluded for a specified period, with exceptions for newborns and adopted children. Additionally, a waiting period must be completed before benefits are payable, although this does not apply to newborns or adopted children. Overall, the page serves to clarify the specific circumstances under which the insurance policy does not provide benefits, ensuring transparency and understanding for policyholders.\n\n\n## page_09\n\nThis page serves as the cover for the NCE Discount Benefit Program's Membership Handbook, highlighting the program's focus on providing discount benefits alongside limited medical benefits. The cover features a family image, reinforcing the program's emphasis on health, wellness, and family-oriented benefits. The NCE logo, with its patriotic elements, suggests a strong brand identity. The program is described as a discount benefit initiative rather than traditional insurance, offering members access to discounts and limited medical services that might not be covered by standard insurance plans. The document is marked 'For Agent Use Only,' indicating its primary audience is insurance agents or representatives, rather than the general consumer. Identification details such as the group number and date are provided for administrative purposes. This introductory cover does not delve into specific benefits, tables, or limitations, suggesting that detailed information is contained within the handbook itself.\n\n\n## page_10\n\nThis page serves as a table of contents for a health discount program document, providing an overview of the various services and savings plans available to members. The program is designed to offer discounts on a wide range of health-related services and products, rather than functioning as traditional insurance. Key sections include dental and vision care discounts, pharmacy savings, and mail-order options for brand-name medications. The program also extends discounts to CBD products, diabetic supplies, and physical therapy services. Additionally, members can benefit from hearing savings programs, medical bill negotiation assistance, and reduced rates on medical supplies and laboratory tests. Nutritional counseling and speech therapy services are also included, along with a 24/7 nurse help line for immediate support. Chiropractic services and savings on vitamins and supplements are part of the offerings, with all services governed by a member agreement that outlines terms and conditions. Importantly, the document emphasizes that this is a discount program, not an insurance plan, highlighting the need for members to understand the nature of the discounts and services provided.\n\n\n## page_11\n\nThe page introduces NCE's GapAfford Plus program, a cost-saving initiative aimed at individuals and families facing high out-of-pocket medical expenses. This program is particularly advantageous for those with high deductible health plans, those without insurance, or individuals who are under-insured. It also supports individuals who cannot obtain insurance due to pre-existing conditions or are in a waiting period for eligibility. \n\nKey features of the program include its target audience, which comprises individuals with high deductibles, no insurance, under-insured status, pre-existing conditions, or those on COBRA. The savings structure is designed to offer savings from the first dollar with no limits, granting access to pre-negotiated lower rates similar to those found in insurance plans. The program is inclusive, covering all household members, including students away at college, and does not require a medical exam for approval, ensuring everyone is eligible. \n\nThe program details emphasize that there are no deductibles or limits involved. It does not impose pre-existing condition limitations (except for ongoing work), medical exams, claim forms, usage limitations, or age restrictions. It is important to note that GapAfford Plus is not an insurance plan but a reduced fee-for-service program. Common questions addressed include household coverage, which includes all members regardless of age, and compatibility with existing insurance, as participants can enroll even if they have other insurance, provided both are accepted by the provider. \n\nLimitations and disclaimers are clearly stated, noting that the program does not meet the requirements of the PPACA, and services must be paid for at the time they are rendered. Additionally, the program is not available in certain states, including Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Contact information is provided for customer service and billing inquiries, along with a website link for program access and provider location.\n\n\n## page_12\n\nThe page provides an in-depth overview of the Aetna Dental Access\u00ae Network, a component of the GapAfford Plus program, designed to offer significant dental savings across the United States. This dental discount program grants members access to over 262,000 dental practice locations nationwide, with savings ranging from 15-50% on various dental services. These services include routine procedures such as cleanings and x-rays, as well as more complex treatments like fillings, root canals, crowns, bridges, and orthodontia.\n\nKey advantages of the program include the absence of waiting periods and age restrictions, no exclusions for pre-existing conditions (except for ongoing work), and no maximum benefit limits. Additionally, members benefit from not having to file paperwork or claims, and the program covers cosmetic dentistry and orthodontia. It can also supplement existing dental insurance and includes vision discounts.\n\nDespite its benefits, the program is not available in certain states, specifically Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. The page also clarifies that this is a discount plan rather than dental insurance, with prices varying based on provider, service, and location. The Aetna Life Insurance Company administers the network but does not provide or guarantee dental care.\n\n\n## page_13\n\nThe page introduces the OUTLOOK Vision network, a comprehensive vision discount program offering significant savings on eyewear and eye care services across the United States. This program provides access to over 12,000 eye care locations, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, independent optical centers, and national chains. However, it is important to note that the program is not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nThe program benefits include savings ranging from 10% to 50% on most prescription eyeglasses, frames, and lenses. Additionally, discounts are available on contact lenses, excluding disposables, and there are savings of 10% to 30% on medical eye exams and surgical procedures such as PRK and LASIK, where available.

The program offers cardholders an average savings of 55% on generic drugs and 15% on brand-name drugs, accessible at over 80% of pharmacies across the United States. The discount applies to all FDA-approved drugs, including lifestyle and pet medications, ensuring broad coverage. The pharmacy network's national reach guarantees that users can benefit from the program in numerous locations.\n\nThe card is user-friendly, with no limits on the number of prescriptions that can be filled. It is pre-activated, never expires, and can be used immediately without requiring any additional forms or activation processes. The card covers the entire household without exclusions and does not collect personal information from users, enhancing privacy and ease of use. To utilize the discount, cardholders simply present the card to pharmacists along with their prescriptions.\n\nWhile the program offers significant benefits, it is important to note that it is a discount program and not an insurance plan. This distinction is crucial for users to understand the nature of the savings and the scope of coverage. Customer support is readily available, with contact details and a website provided for further assistance and information.\n\n\n## page_15\n\nThe page provides an in-depth look at MedAfford Global's mail-order prescription medication program, highlighting its potential for significant cost savings and the convenience it offers to consumers. The program promises savings of up to 80% on prescription medications, with notable savings on insulin medications of 45% or more. The process is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, allowing customers to price their medications online and place orders either through the website or via a phone call. Customers are required to provide an Rx Group code and a valid prescription from their doctor. Medications are then shipped directly to the customer's address, with email confirmations sent upon order placement.\n\nThe page includes detailed pricing information for both brand-name and generic medications, presented in tabular format. For brand-name medications, examples such as Abilify 10mg, Jardiance 25mg, and Xarelto 20mg are listed with their respective prices for a 90-day supply. Similarly, generic medications like Amlodipine 10mg, Metformin ER 500mg, and Omeprazole 20mg are also priced for a 90-day supply. It is important to note that these prices exclude a $4.95 shipping fee and any insurance costs for shipment. Pricing is subject to change due to fluctuations in drug costs through international pharmacies.\n\nThe program is clarified as a discount service rather than an insurance plan, administered by National Benefit Builders, Inc. The content is specifically intended for agent use only, emphasizing the professional nature of the information provided.\n\n\n## page_16\n\nThis page provides an insightful overview of CBD products, focusing on their health benefits and unique features. It begins with an introduction to CBD, highlighting its origin from hemp plants and its non-intoxicating nature, which ensures it does not impair mental clarity, making it suitable for daily use. The health benefits of CBD are emphasized, positioning it as a natural alternative to prescription painkillers. The narrative suggests that CBD can promote a sense of peace and balance, contributing to a healthier lifestyle through plant-based relief.\n\nThe page also distinguishes the company\u2019s products through several key differentiators. Compliance with the Farm Bill Act of 2018 is highlighted, ensuring that legal standards are met. The emphasis on quality assurance is evident, with products being pharmacist-formulated and full-spectrum. The commitment to purity and potency is reinforced by multi-stage third-party laboratory testing, ensuring ingredient potency. Transparency is a priority, with QR codes on packaging that allow consumers to access lab results easily.\n\nVisual elements include an image of a CBD product, which aligns with the natural and health-focused theme of the content. Contact information is provided, offering customer service and billing contacts, as well as a website for further engagement and locating providers. Despite the positive portrayal, the page notes limitations, such as the lack of specific scientific evidence supporting the health claims and the general nature of the benefits described.\n\n\n## page_17\n\nThis page outlines a discount program designed to provide significant savings on diabetic supplies, physical therapy, rehabilitation services, and hearing aids. It is important to note that this program is not an insurance plan but rather a discount initiative aimed at reducing costs for specific healthcare needs.\n\nThe program offers substantial discounts on diabetic supplies, with savings ranging from 20% to 85% off retail prices. This includes essential items such as glucose test strips, glucose monitors, lancets, blood pressure monitors, and urinalysis test strips.

Additionally, it includes a free deluxe warranty program and up to a 3-year supply of batteries, enhancing the value for participants. Consistent contact information is provided across all sections for ease of access to support and further details.\n\n\n## page_18\n\nThis page outlines two distinct services designed to assist members in reducing healthcare-related expenses. The first section focuses on Medical Bill Negotiations, a service that aids members in lowering their medical bills that are not covered by existing benefits. This service involves patient advocates who negotiate with healthcare providers on behalf of the members. To qualify for this service, the medical bill must be at least $5,000, and members are required to make full payment to the provider once a negotiation is successfully completed. Contact information, including customer service and billing numbers, as well as a website link, is provided for members to access the program and find providers.\n\nThe second section details discounts available on Medical Supplies & Equipment.

The Laboratory Savings Program offers members access to a wide range of medical laboratory tests, providing an affordable and confidential solution for medical testing needs. Members can explore various tests and related disease information and purchase tests directly through the program's website. However, this program is not available in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, highlighting a geographical limitation. The SDO Nutrition program focuses on assisting individuals in achieving personal health goals and managing chronic conditions through dietary guidance. It offers services such as weight loss, dietary restrictions, geriatric health, and management of conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. Both programs emphasize that they are not insurance but discount programs, providing a cost-effective alternative for health management. The contact information and website are consistent for both programs, indicating a centralized system for member inquiries and service access.\n\n\n## page_20\n\nThis page introduces two innovative healthcare services offered as part of a discount program: Speech Therapy through telepractice and a 24/7 Nurse Help Line.

It is positioned as an alternative to traditional therapy, requiring users to have a computer, high-speed internet, a web camera, and a quiet room. The sessions are designed to be engaging, with therapists using therapeutic activities and providing materials and follow-up resources. Contact information for customer service and billing is readily available, along with a website for accessing the program.\n\nThe 24/7 Nurse Help Line offers continuous access to registered nurses who can assist with family health issues in over 100 languages.

It is important to note that this program is not provided by AccessOne DMPO, although the contact and access details remain consistent with the Chiropractic Program.\n\nThe page emphasizes that this is a discount program and not an insurance plan, aiming to help members reduce costs on health and wellness services and products. Visuals accompanying the text include images of chiropractic adjustments and vitamins, enhancing the understanding of the program's offerings.\n\n\n## page_22\n\nThe document provides a detailed overview of the GapAfford Plus program, a Discount Medical Plan Organization managed by AccessOne Consumer Health, Inc.

The document lists various services eligible for discounts, including chiropractic care, medical equipment, rehabilitation services, hearing services, and pharmacies. Additionally, dental and vision services offer discounts on standard billed charges.\n\nParticipation in the program is contingent upon regular payments, and membership can be canceled with written notice. A refund policy is available if cancellation occurs within the first 30 days. The plan also includes family members, allowing dependent children to be covered at no extra charge, with options to add additional children through a specified contact number. Complaints are managed through a designated webpage or phone number, with a commitment to respond within 15 days.\n\nThe document emphasizes that the plan is not a Qualified Health Plan under the Affordable Care Act and does not meet certain federal and state health insurance requirements. It is also not a Medicare prescription drug plan. Members are advised to retain a copy of the agreement for their records, as it supersedes all prior representations and does not guarantee service quality or liability.\n\n\n## page_23\n\nThis page provides an introductory overview of the National Benefit Builders Discount Program, emphasizing its nature as a discount program rather than an insurance plan. This distinction is crucial for potential users to understand the scope and limitations of the program.

  "aggregated_content": "## page_01\n\nThis page provides an introductory overview of a specific insurance product offered by Everest Reinsurance Company, facilitated through NCE. The insurance type is identified as 'Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance,' which typically offers a set payout for designated services, independent of the actual costs incurred. This structure is particularly advantageous for managing routine medical expenses. The plan incorporates the Multiplan PPO Network, which allows for flexibility in selecting healthcare providers and generally offers enhanced coverage for services provided by in-network providers. The visual theme of the slide, featuring an image of two individuals walking on a beach, underscores themes of care, support, and well-being, aligning with the insurance's objective of providing financial protection related to health. The slide is specifically intended for insurance agents, as indicated by the 'For Agent Use Only' note, suggesting its role in training or informing agents about the insurance plan. However, the slide does not delve into specific benefits, limitations, or exclusions, which are essential for a thorough understanding of the insurance offering.\n\n\n## page_02\n\nThis page introduces the Everest Group Indemnity Insurance, emphasizing its role as a supplementary insurance plan designed to cover unexpected medical expenses that are not fully covered by primary insurance. The plan is particularly useful for managing costs such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, providing fixed payments to alleviate financial stress during recovery from accidents or illnesses. \n\nThe document outlines how indemnity insurance supplements existing coverage by offering cash benefits, with an illustrative example of a 35-year-old woman who could receive a total benefit of $3,175 from various components like hospital admission and physician office visits. This flexibility allows clients to use the funds for a range of expenses, including medical costs, transportation, and childcare, highlighting the autonomy and financial relief provided by the plan.\n\nAdditionally, the page lists compelling reasons to choose Everest Group Indemnity Insurance, such as access to the Multiplan PPO Network, direct benefit payments to clients, and a simplified claims process ensuring quick payouts. However, it also includes a disclaimer noting that benefit payouts are estimates and subject to policy-specific terms, conditions, and exclusions, clarifying that this insurance is not a substitute for major medical coverage.\n\n\n## page_03\n\nThis page provides an in-depth analysis of the Everest Group Fixed Indemnity Plan options, specifically detailing Plan 100, Plan 200, Plan 200+, and Plan 300. Each plan is designed to offer varying levels of benefits and coverage, tailored to meet different needs and circumstances. The plans are structured with specific limitations and conditions, which are crucial for potential policyholders to understand.\n\nThe plans feature a '12-12 Pre-Existing Conditions' limitation, imposing a 12-month waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions. Despite this, all plans are 'Guaranteed Issue,' ensuring that eligibility is not contingent upon the applicant's health status. Confinement benefits are a significant component, with hospital confinement benefits ranging from $100 to $300 per day, depending on the plan. ICU confinement benefits are similarly structured, with coverage available for up to 30 days per confinement and 90 days per certificate year.\n\nHospital benefits include coverage for emergency room visits, limited to two visits per certificate year with a $50 benefit per visit. Plans 200+ and 300 offer additional surgery benefits. Procedure benefits are available in the higher-tier plans, providing a combined inpatient and outpatient benefit. Outpatient benefits vary across plans, with coverage for lab work, X-rays, advanced diagnostics, and physician office visits. Limitations include exclusions for chiropractic and acupuncture services, with benefits subject to state-specific terms and conditions.\n\n\n## page_04\n\nThis page provides a detailed comparison of four group fixed indemnity plans offered by Everest, specifically Plan 500, Plan 750, Plan 1000, and Plan 1000+. Each plan is analyzed based on its benefits, coverage, and limitations. The plans are structured with a 'Guaranteed Issue' underwriting level, ensuring that applicants cannot be denied coverage due to health conditions. \n\nThe benefits include hospital and ICU confinement payments, with amounts increasing from Plan 500 to Plan 1000+. Emergency room visits are limited to two per certificate year, with reimbursement amounts varying by plan. Hospital admission benefits are notably higher in Plan 1000+, allowing for five admissions per certificate year. Surgical procedures are covered for up to three days per year, with daily reimbursement amounts increasing with higher-tier plans. Anesthesia costs are uniformly covered at 25% across all plans.\n\nOutpatient benefits cover X-rays, labs, advanced diagnostics, and physician office visits, with specific limits on the number of covered days or visits per year. Reimbursement amounts for these services also increase with higher-tier plans. However, the plans include a 12-month pre-existing condition limitation, and there is no coverage for chiropractic or acupuncture care. Benefits are provided on a per-person basis, and policy terms may vary by state.\n\n\n## page_05\n\nThis page provides an in-depth FAQ section for the Everest Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance, a supplemental health plan designed to offer fixed payments for specific covered medical expenses. The insurance is characterized by its fixed benefit structure, which is particularly beneficial for managing predictable healthcare costs. Members have access to a network of participating providers, where they can avail discounts by using a dedicated website or contacting a specified phone number. The plan includes coverage for advanced diagnostic tests such as angiograms, bone marrow tests, and MRIs, ensuring comprehensive diagnostic care.\n\nThe document clarifies the definitions of 'Calendar Year' and 'Certificate Year', with the former spanning from January 1st to December 31st, and the latter aligning with the plan year as indicated in the Certificate Schedule. A notable feature is the 'Free Look Period', which allows policyholders a 10-day window to return the certificate for any reason, providing flexibility and assurance to the insured.\n\nAdditionally, the page defines 'Confinement' as hospital admissions for inpatient services, with benefits calculated on a per-day basis. 'Diagnostic Care' is described as essential medical services for diagnosing conditions, including tests and biopsies. The MultiPlan PPO Network is highlighted as a valuable component, offering a broad range of provider options with discounted services, enhancing the plan's flexibility and accessibility.\n\n\n## page_06\n\nThis page provides a detailed examination of the exclusions and limitations inherent in the insurance plan, focusing on specific medical and non-medical services that are not covered. It is essential for policyholders to understand these exclusions to avoid unexpected expenses. The document specifies that coverage for breast surgery is limited to reconstruction following a medically necessary mastectomy due to cancer treatment, excluding procedures like capsular contraction, augmentation, or reduction mammoplasty unless related to cancer treatment. Services provided by individuals who do not typically charge for their services are not covered unless there is a legal obligation to do so.\n\nCosmetic surgery is generally excluded, except when reconstructive surgery is necessary due to trauma, infection, or congenital conditions affecting a dependent child. Dental care and treatment are also excluded unless related to accidental injury or congenital conditions affecting a dependent child's functional dental structure. Elective treatments or surgeries are not covered under the plan. Additionally, no benefits are extended for treatments considered experimental or investigational.\n\nThe plan excludes coverage for accidents resulting from participation in extreme sports such as skydiving and bungee jumping. Services rendered by family members are not eligible for benefits. Coverage for treatments outside the United States is excluded unless incurred during business or pleasure travel and in case of an emergency approved for use in the U.S., with a restriction of 30 days. This page serves as a critical reference for understanding the limitations of the insurance coverage.\n\n\n## page_07\n\nThis page provides an in-depth analysis of the exclusions present in an insurance policy, highlighting various scenarios where benefits are not payable. The exclusions cover a wide range of situations, ensuring policyholders are aware of the limitations of their coverage. Key exclusions include gender-related treatments, such as those for gender transformation or sexual function enhancement, which are not covered. Additionally, injuries sustained from hazardous activities, particularly those involving professional sports or occupations, are excluded from coverage.\n\nThe policy also excludes losses resulting from illegal acts or while the insured is incarcerated. Intoxication-related losses, especially those occurring while operating a vehicle, are not covered, with proof based on state laws and medical reports. Only medically necessary treatments are covered, excluding others. Mental illness and substance abuse-related losses are generally excluded unless specific benefits apply. Losses due to narcotics, unless prescribed, and conditions resulting from illegal substance overdose are also excluded.\n\nPregnancy-related services are not covered unless the life of the pregnant person is endangered, with some exceptions under specific benefits. Furthermore, losses incurred during active military service are not payable. This detailed guide is crucial for policyholders to understand the boundaries of their insurance coverage, helping them avoid unexpected financial burdens by recognizing these limitations.\n\n\n## page_08\n\nThis page provides a detailed overview of the exclusions and limitations associated with a health insurance policy. It highlights specific conditions, treatments, and activities that are not covered under the plan, ensuring that policyholders are fully informed of their coverage boundaries. The document begins by addressing exclusions related to the musculoskeletal system and acupuncture, specifying that treatments involving nerve interference or vertebral column misalignment are not covered. Additionally, it excludes coverage for Meridian therapy and acupuncture.\n\nThe policy also outlines exclusions related to sports activities, where injuries sustained during intercollegiate, interscholastic, or organized competitive sports are not covered. However, recreational community sports activities are not excluded. Furthermore, the policy does not cover losses resulting from suicide or intentional self-inflicted injuries, regardless of the intent behind them.\n\nAnother significant exclusion pertains to accidents involving an unlicensed driver, unless the driver holds a learner's permit and is under instruction. Losses due to war, riots, insurrections, or armed forces service are also not covered, although terrorism-related losses are not excluded. The policy excludes benefits for weight-related treatments, including surgeries and counseling for weight control and obesity.\n\nCoverage is also denied for conditions that are eligible under workers' compensation laws, even if no claim is filed. Pre-existing conditions are excluded for a specified period, with exceptions for newborns and adopted children. Additionally, a waiting period must be completed before benefits are payable, although this does not apply to newborns or adopted children. Overall, the page serves to clarify the specific circumstances under which the insurance policy does not provide benefits, ensuring transparency and understanding for policyholders.\n\n\n## page_09\n\nThis page serves as the cover for the NCE Discount Benefit Program's Membership Handbook, highlighting the program's focus on providing discount benefits alongside limited medical benefits. The cover features a family image, reinforcing the program's emphasis on health, wellness, and family-oriented benefits. The NCE logo, with its patriotic elements, suggests a strong brand identity. The program is described as a discount benefit initiative rather than traditional insurance, offering members access to discounts and limited medical services that might not be covered by standard insurance plans. The document is marked 'For Agent Use Only,' indicating its primary audience is insurance agents or representatives, rather than the general consumer. Identification details such as the group number and date are provided for administrative purposes. This introductory cover does not delve into specific benefits, tables, or limitations, suggesting that detailed information is contained within the handbook itself.\n\n\n## page_10\n\nThis page serves as a table of contents for a health discount program document, providing an overview of the various services and savings plans available to members. The program is designed to offer discounts on a wide range of health-related services and products, rather than functioning as traditional insurance. Key sections include dental and vision care discounts, pharmacy savings, and mail-order options for brand-name medications. The program also extends discounts to CBD products, diabetic supplies, and physical therapy services. Additionally, members can benefit from hearing savings programs, medical bill negotiation assistance, and reduced rates on medical supplies and laboratory tests. Nutritional counseling and speech therapy services are also included, along with a 24/7 nurse help line for immediate support. Chiropractic services and savings on vitamins and supplements are part of the offerings, with all services governed by a member agreement that outlines terms and conditions. Importantly, the document emphasizes that this is a discount program, not an insurance plan, highlighting the need for members to understand the nature of the discounts and services provided.\n\n\n## page_11\n\nThe page introduces NCE's GapAfford Plus program, a cost-saving initiative aimed at individuals and families facing high out-of-pocket medical expenses. This program is particularly advantageous for those with high deductible health plans, those without insurance, or individuals who are under-insured. It also supports individuals who cannot obtain insurance due to pre-existing conditions or are in a waiting period for eligibility. \n\nKey features of the program include its target audience, which comprises individuals with high deductibles, no insurance, under-insured status, pre-existing conditions, or those on COBRA. The savings structure is designed to offer savings from the first dollar with no limits, granting access to pre-negotiated lower rates similar to those found in insurance plans. The program is inclusive, covering all household members, including students away at college, and does not require a medical exam for approval, ensuring everyone is eligible. \n\nThe program details emphasize that there are no deductibles or limits involved. It does not impose pre-existing condition limitations (except for ongoing work), medical exams, claim forms, usage limitations, or age restrictions. It is important to note that GapAfford Plus is not an insurance plan but a reduced fee-for-service program. Common questions addressed include household coverage, which includes all members regardless of age, and compatibility with existing insurance, as participants can enroll even if they have other insurance, provided both are accepted by the provider. \n\nLimitations and disclaimers are clearly stated, noting that the program does not meet the requirements of the PPACA, and services must be paid for at the time they are rendered. Additionally, the program is not available in certain states, including Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Contact information is provided for customer service and billing inquiries, along with a website link for program access and provider location.\n\n\n## page_12\n\nThe page provides an in-depth overview of the Aetna Dental Access\u00ae Network, a component of the GapAfford Plus program, designed to offer significant dental savings across the United States. This dental discount program grants members access to over 262,000 dental practice locations nationwide, with savings ranging from 15-50% on various dental services. These services include routine procedures such as cleanings and x-rays, as well as more complex treatments like fillings, root canals, crowns, bridges, and orthodontia.\n\nKey advantages of the program include the absence of waiting periods and age restrictions, no exclusions for pre-existing conditions (except for ongoing work), and no maximum benefit limits. Additionally, members benefit from not having to file paperwork or claims, and the program covers cosmetic dentistry and orthodontia. It can also supplement existing dental insurance and includes vision discounts.\n\nDespite its benefits, the program is not available in certain states, specifically Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. The page also clarifies that this is a discount plan rather than dental insurance, with prices varying based on provider, service, and location. The Aetna Life Insurance Company administers the network but does not provide or guarantee dental care.\n\n\n## page_13\n\nThe page introduces the OUTLOOK Vision network, a comprehensive vision discount program offering significant savings on eyewear and eye care services across the United States. This program provides access to over 12,000 eye care locations, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, independent optical centers, and national chains. However, it is important to note that the program is not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nThe program benefits include savings ranging from 10% to 50% on most prescription eyeglasses, frames, and lenses. Additionally, discounts are available on contact lenses, excluding disposables, and there are savings of 10% to 30% on medical eye exams and surgical procedures such as PRK and LASIK, where available. A sample table illustrates the potential savings at various locations, comparing retail prices to member prices, with savings percentages highlighted.\n\nParticipating providers include major vision care providers such as Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, J.C. Penney Optical, LensCrafters, and Visionworks, ensuring widespread availability with thousands of participating locations. Customer service information is provided, including contact numbers and a website link for accessing the program and locating providers. It is emphasized that prices and savings are subject to change and may vary by provider and geographic area. The program is explicitly described as a discount program, not insurance.\n\n\n## page_14\n\nThis page introduces a pharmacy discount program designed to provide substantial savings on prescription medications. The program offers cardholders an average savings of 55% on generic drugs and 15% on brand-name drugs, accessible at over 80% of pharmacies across the United States. The discount applies to all FDA-approved drugs, including lifestyle and pet medications, ensuring broad coverage. The pharmacy network's national reach guarantees that users can benefit from the program in numerous locations.\n\nThe card is user-friendly, with no limits on the number of prescriptions that can be filled. It is pre-activated, never expires, and can be used immediately without requiring any additional forms or activation processes. The card covers the entire household without exclusions and does not collect personal information from users, enhancing privacy and ease of use. To utilize the discount, cardholders simply present the card to pharmacists along with their prescriptions.\n\nWhile the program offers significant benefits, it is important to note that it is a discount program and not an insurance plan. This distinction is crucial for users to understand the nature of the savings and the scope of coverage. Customer support is readily available, with contact details and a website provided for further assistance and information.\n\n\n## page_15\n\nThe page provides an in-depth look at MedAfford Global's mail-order prescription medication program, highlighting its potential for significant cost savings and the convenience it offers to consumers. The program promises savings of up to 80% on prescription medications, with notable savings on insulin medications of 45% or more. The process is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, allowing customers to price their medications online and place orders either through the website or via a phone call. Customers are required to provide an Rx Group code and a valid prescription from their doctor. Medications are then shipped directly to the customer's address, with email confirmations sent upon order placement.\n\nThe page includes detailed pricing information for both brand-name and generic medications, presented in tabular format. For brand-name medications, examples such as Abilify 10mg, Jardiance 25mg, and Xarelto 20mg are listed with their respective prices for a 90-day supply. Similarly, generic medications like Amlodipine 10mg, Metformin ER 500mg, and Omeprazole 20mg are also priced for a 90-day supply. It is important to note that these prices exclude a $4.95 shipping fee and any insurance costs for shipment. Pricing is subject to change due to fluctuations in drug costs through international pharmacies.\n\nThe program is clarified as a discount service rather than an insurance plan, administered by National Benefit Builders, Inc. The content is specifically intended for agent use only, emphasizing the professional nature of the information provided.\n\n\n## page_16\n\nThis page provides an insightful overview of CBD products, focusing on their health benefits and unique features. It begins with an introduction to CBD, highlighting its origin from hemp plants and its non-intoxicating nature, which ensures it does not impair mental clarity, making it suitable for daily use. The health benefits of CBD are emphasized, positioning it as a natural alternative to prescription painkillers. The narrative suggests that CBD can promote a sense of peace and balance, contributing to a healthier lifestyle through plant-based relief.\n\nThe page also distinguishes the company\u2019s products through several key differentiators. Compliance with the Farm Bill Act of 2018 is highlighted, ensuring that legal standards are met. The emphasis on quality assurance is evident, with products being pharmacist-formulated and full-spectrum. The commitment to purity and potency is reinforced by multi-stage third-party laboratory testing, ensuring ingredient potency. Transparency is a priority, with QR codes on packaging that allow consumers to access lab results easily.\n\nVisual elements include an image of a CBD product, which aligns with the natural and health-focused theme of the content. Contact information is provided, offering customer service and billing contacts, as well as a website for further engagement and locating providers. Despite the positive portrayal, the page notes limitations, such as the lack of specific scientific evidence supporting the health claims and the general nature of the benefits described.\n\n\n## page_17\n\nThis page outlines a discount program designed to provide significant savings on diabetic supplies, physical therapy, rehabilitation services, and hearing aids. It is important to note that this program is not an insurance plan but rather a discount initiative aimed at reducing costs for specific healthcare needs.\n\nThe program offers substantial discounts on diabetic supplies, with savings ranging from 20% to 85% off retail prices. This includes essential items such as glucose test strips, glucose monitors, lancets, blood pressure monitors, and urinalysis test strips. Customers are encouraged to reach out to the provided customer service contacts or visit the website for more detailed information.\n\nFor physical therapy and rehabilitation services, the program provides an average of 20% savings at over 1,200 locations, covering 4,000 providers across 23 states. This broad network ensures that participants can access necessary services at a reduced cost.\n\nThe hearing savings program offers free annual hearing consultations at more than 3,000 locations, along with exclusive discounts on various hearing aid technologies and styles. Additionally, it includes a free deluxe warranty program and up to a 3-year supply of batteries, enhancing the value for participants. Consistent contact information is provided across all sections for ease of access to support and further details.\n\n\n## page_18\n\nThis page outlines two distinct services designed to assist members in reducing healthcare-related expenses. The first section focuses on Medical Bill Negotiations, a service that aids members in lowering their medical bills that are not covered by existing benefits. This service involves patient advocates who negotiate with healthcare providers on behalf of the members. To qualify for this service, the medical bill must be at least $5,000, and members are required to make full payment to the provider once a negotiation is successfully completed. Contact information, including customer service and billing numbers, as well as a website link, is provided for members to access the program and find providers.\n\nThe second section details discounts available on Medical Supplies & Equipment. Members can benefit from savings ranging from 20% to 50% on various medical supplies, such as ambulatory aids and bathroom safety items, including wheelchairs, scooters, and hospital beds. Similar to the negotiation services, contact information is provided to facilitate access to these discounts.\n\nIt is important to note that these services are part of a discount program under AccessOne DMPO and not an insurance program. The slide emphasizes the financial advantages these services offer to members by reducing out-of-pocket healthcare costs through effective negotiation and discounted purchases.\n\n\n## page_19\n\nThis page provides a detailed overview of two distinct health-related programs designed to support members in managing their health efficiently and affordably. The Laboratory Savings Program offers members access to a wide range of medical laboratory tests, providing an affordable and confidential solution for medical testing needs. Members can explore various tests and related disease information and purchase tests directly through the program's website. However, this program is not available in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, highlighting a geographical limitation. The SDO Nutrition program focuses on assisting individuals in achieving personal health goals and managing chronic conditions through dietary guidance. It offers services such as weight loss, dietary restrictions, geriatric health, and management of conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. Both programs emphasize that they are not insurance but discount programs, providing a cost-effective alternative for health management. The contact information and website are consistent for both programs, indicating a centralized system for member inquiries and service access.\n\n\n## page_20\n\nThis page introduces two innovative healthcare services offered as part of a discount program: Speech Therapy through telepractice and a 24/7 Nurse Help Line. The Speech Therapy service leverages video conferencing technology to provide live, one-on-one, and interactive sessions globally. It is positioned as an alternative to traditional therapy, requiring users to have a computer, high-speed internet, a web camera, and a quiet room. The sessions are designed to be engaging, with therapists using therapeutic activities and providing materials and follow-up resources. Contact information for customer service and billing is readily available, along with a website for accessing the program.\n\nThe 24/7 Nurse Help Line offers continuous access to registered nurses who can assist with family health issues in over 100 languages. This service provides medical information assistance and emphasizes ease of access through customer service lines and online resources. Both services are highlighted as part of a discount program and are not insurance programs, underscoring their role in providing accessible healthcare support.\n\n\n## page_21\n\nThis page outlines a savings program designed to offer significant discounts on chiropractic services and wellness products, specifically vitamins and supplements. The program is divided into two main sections, each focusing on different aspects of the savings opportunities available to members.\n\nThe Chiropractic Savings Program provides members with a free initial consultation and offers up to 50% savings on diagnostic services and necessary X-rays. Members can also benefit from unlimited treatments with savings of up to 30%. The program grants access to a national network of over 12,000 chiropractors, ensuring wide availability of services. For assistance, contact information for customer service and billing is provided, along with a website for accessing the program and locating providers.\n\nIn the Vitamins & Supplements section, members can enjoy savings of up to 75% off retail prices on a wide selection of natural products, including vitamins and supplements. It is important to note that this program is not provided by AccessOne DMPO, although the contact and access details remain consistent with the Chiropractic Program.\n\nThe page emphasizes that this is a discount program and not an insurance plan, aiming to help members reduce costs on health and wellness services and products. Visuals accompanying the text include images of chiropractic adjustments and vitamins, enhancing the understanding of the program's offerings.\n\n\n## page_22\n\nThe document provides a detailed overview of the GapAfford Plus program, a Discount Medical Plan Organization managed by AccessOne Consumer Health, Inc. It is important to note that this program is not an insurance policy but rather offers discounts at selected healthcare providers. Enrollment in the program begins on the date specified on the Member ID and continues on a monthly basis until the member decides to cancel. The payment structure involves periodic charges and processing fees, and there are established procedures for handling complaints within the organization.\n\nThe plan explicitly states that it is not insurance and does not make direct payments to healthcare providers. Instead, members are responsible for paying for services but can benefit from discounts at contracted providers. The document lists various services eligible for discounts, including chiropractic care, medical equipment, rehabilitation services, hearing services, and pharmacies. Additionally, dental and vision services offer discounts on standard billed charges.\n\nParticipation in the program is contingent upon regular payments, and membership can be canceled with written notice. A refund policy is available if cancellation occurs within the first 30 days. The plan also includes family members, allowing dependent children to be covered at no extra charge, with options to add additional children through a specified contact number. Complaints are managed through a designated webpage or phone number, with a commitment to respond within 15 days.\n\nThe document emphasizes that the plan is not a Qualified Health Plan under the Affordable Care Act and does not meet certain federal and state health insurance requirements. It is also not a Medicare prescription drug plan. Members are advised to retain a copy of the agreement for their records, as it supersedes all prior representations and does not guarantee service quality or liability.\n\n\n## page_23\n\nThis page provides an introductory overview of the National Benefit Builders Discount Program, emphasizing its nature as a discount program rather than an insurance plan. This distinction is crucial for potential users to understand the scope and limitations of the program. The program is accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) with the highest rating, which underscores its credibility and reliability. The presence of the National Benefit Builders, Inc. logo and the note 'For Agent Use Only' suggests that this page is part of a training or informational packet designed for agents who will be promoting the program. Additionally, the inclusion of a 2022 copyright notice highlights the currency and relevance of the information provided. However, the slide does not delve into specific details about the benefits, services, or limitations of the discount program. There is a lack of information regarding specific discounts, access methods, eligibility criteria, or potential costs associated with enrollment. This page primarily serves as a general introduction, focusing on branding and accreditation rather than the detailed specifics of the program.",

Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on Business Workers of America, or BWA. We'll walk through what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits BWA offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Let's begin with understanding what an association is 

At its core, associations are organizations formed to serve collective member interests. 

They provide access to various important services 

with a particular focus on health insurance plans

The key strength of an association lies in its ability to leverage collective purchasing power 

allowing it to negotiate better terms and coverage for all its members.

---- How Associations Work ----

Now, let me explain how associations operate. 

An association acts as an intermediary between providers and members, 

playing a crucial role in negotiating group rates and terms. 

They manage the entire enrollment process 

and provide ongoing member support 

Through this structure, they effectively coordinate benefit offerings for all members.

---- About BWA ----

BWA, or Business Workers of America, 

is a not-for-profit member association that was founded in 2006. 

Their mission is dedicated to improving workers' lives 

by enhancing their standard of living 

and providing access to valuable savings. 

They actively influence both federal and state legislation 

to benefit the American workforce, ensuring memberâ€™s interests are represented at every level.

---- BWA & Plan Relationship ----

Before we discuss plan benefits with clients, there's required information we must cover with them.

Members must be working and

become a member of BWA Association to be eligible for plan and member benefits. This allows members to not only 

take advantage of BWA Membership health benefits 

but other benefits as well. 

---- MBR Benefits ----

assists with claim filing 

and coordinates insurance benefits with bill reductions

Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the NCE Association Insurance Plans. We'll walk through the plans' key features, benefits, and coverage details. Let's get started!

---- NCE Association Insurance Overview ----

The NCE Association offers insurance plans underwritten by the United States Fire Insurance Company, providing Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity and Group Accident Insurance exclusively to NCE Members. These plans are designed to supplement traditional health insurance and provide additional financial protection in case of hospitalizations or accidents.

---- Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity Benefits ----

Moving on to the Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity plan, it offers valuable benefits to help cover costs associated with hospital stays and medical procedures. The Daily Inpatient Hospital Confinement Benefit provides a fixed daily amount for each day you are confined to a hospital for a covered illness or injury. Additionally, the plan includes an Intensive Care or Coronary Care Unit Benefit, which pays a higher daily amount if you require intensive care during your hospital stay.

The plan also covers surgical procedures performed in a hospital setting through the Surgery and Anesthesia Benefit. It's important to note that this benefit applies only to surgeries performed in a hospital and excludes experimental or cosmetic procedures.

---- Group Accident Insurance Benefits ----

Shifting gears to the Group Accident Insurance plan, it provides financial support in the event of injuries sustained from a covered accident. The Hospital Confinement Benefit pays a daily amount for each day you are confined to a hospital due to an accidental injury. If you require intensive care, the Daily Intensive Care or Coronary Care Benefit kicks in, providing a higher daily payment.

In case of an emergency, the plan offers an Emergency Room Benefit, which covers a portion of the costs associated with an emergency room visit due to an accidental injury. Additionally, the Daily Recovery Benefit provides a daily payment to assist with recovery expenses after a hospital stay due to an accidental injury.

It's important to note that these accident benefits apply only to injuries resulting from covered accidents and exclude sicknesses, diseases, or bodily infirmities not caused by an accident.

---- Additional Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity Benefits ----

The Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity plan also includes several other valuable benefits. The Daily Outpatient Surgery Benefit covers necessary surgeries performed in a hospital or physician's office, excluding cosmetic procedures. The Daily Inpatient Diagnostic Radiology, X-ray and Laboratory Test Benefit pays for these tests when performed during a covered hospital stay.

Furthermore, the Daily Outpatient Laboratory Test Benefit covers laboratory tests performed in a hospital outpatient setting or physician's office when you are not confined to a hospital. It's important to note that fertility treatments and cosmetic surgeries are generally excluded from these benefits.

---- Additional Group Accident Insurance Benefits ----

The Group Accident Insurance plan offers additional benefits beyond hospital confinement and emergency care. The Daily Inpatient Surgery Benefit covers surgeries performed during a hospital stay due to an accidental injury. The Daily Inpatient Diagnostic Radiology, X-ray and Imaging Benefit pays for these tests when performed during a covered hospital confinement.

For outpatient procedures, the Daily Outpatient Surgery Benefit and the Daily Outpatient Diagnostic Radiology, X-ray and Imaging Benefit provide coverage for surgeries and tests performed without being admitted to a hospital. Additionally, the plan includes a Daily Inpatient Laboratory Test Benefit and a Daily Outpatient Laboratory Test Benefit for covered laboratory tests.

It's important to note that these benefits are specific to injuries resulting from covered accidents and do not apply to sicknesses or diseases.

---- NCE Association Membership ----

As an NCE Association member, you have access to a range of valuable benefits and services designed to support small and medium-sized businesses. The Premier Plan Insured Benefits offer accident-only plans, which differ from traditional health insurance. These plans provide financial protection in case of accidents or hospitalizations, rather than comprehensive medical coverage.

When you join the NCE Association, you'll receive a Membership Packet and ID Cards, making it easy to access your benefits. To be eligible for the Group Hospital Fixed Indemnity and Group Accident Insurance Plans, you must be an active member of the association.

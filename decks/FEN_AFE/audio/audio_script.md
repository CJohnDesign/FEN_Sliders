Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Association for Entrepreneurship, or AFE. We'll walk through what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits AFE offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Let's begin with understanding what an association is 

At its core, associations are organizations formed to serve collective member interests. 

They provide access to various important services 

with a particular focus on limited medical and discount plans

The key strength of an association lies in its ability to leverage collective purchasing power 

allowing it to negotiate better terms and coverage for all its members.

---- How Associations Work ----

Now, let me explain how associations operate. 

An association acts as an intermediary between providers and members, 

playing a crucial role in negotiating group rates and terms. 

They manage the entire enrollment process 

and provide ongoing member support 

Through this structure, they effectively coordinate benefit offerings for all members.

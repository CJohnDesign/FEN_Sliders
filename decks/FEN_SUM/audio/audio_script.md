Hello! Thank you for joining today's training session on Summit plans. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to Summit ----

Summit, underwritten by Everest Reinsurance Company, is a product you'll be offering that provides 

flexible coverage for various medical situations. 

When presenting to prospects, emphasize how it combines hospital indemnity benefits with extensive support tools to help members navigate their healthcare journey. 

Membership is available through the National Congress of Employers, which you should refer to as NCE when speaking with prospects, granting access to these exclusive benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let's explore the key features you'll be highlighting to prospects. 

Hospital Confinement Benefits provide daily financial support when your members are admitted to a hospital, ranging from one hundred to one thousand dollars per day depending on the plan level, with up to 90 days of coverage per year.

Hospital Admission Benefits on Plan 1000 Plus offer a unique one-time benefit of one thousand dollars per hospital admission, with up to 5 admissions per year, providing immediate financial assistance.

Emergency Room Benefits ensure your members have coverage for unexpected medical emergencies, with benefits ranging from fifty to one hundred dollars per visit and up to 2 visits per year across all plans.

Diagnostic Testing Benefits include laboratory work, diagnostic X-rays, and advanced diagnostic testing on select plans, with varying coverage levels and frequency based on the plan chosen.

Surgery Benefits starting with Plan 200 Plus provide coverage for surgical procedures ranging from two hundred fifty to five hundred dollars per day, plus anesthesia benefits at twenty-five percent of the surgical benefit amount.

Physician Office Visit Benefits cover medical office visits with fifty to seventy-five dollars per visit depending on the plan level, ensuring access to routine medical care. 

Age Eligibility covers individuals from 18 to 64 years old, with dependent unmarried children covered under the age of 25, ensuring family coverage for those who need it most.

---- NCE Healthcare & Medical Services ----

When discussing the healthcare and medical services offered through the National Congress of Employers association, you'll want to emphasize the value proposition. 

Your prospects will receive medical support including bill negotiations, 24/7 nurse access, laboratory savings, and discounts on medical supplies. 

For dental and vision discounts, NCE provides significant savings through the Aetna Dental Access Network and OUTLOOK Vision Network, offering 15 to 50 percent savings on routine and specialty services that you can highlight as immediate value. Please note that these programs are not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington.

---- NCE Prescription & Health Products ----

Next, here's how you'll present the prescription and health product benefits to prospects.

NCE offers substantial prescription savings with discount cards and specialized programs, including significant savings on diabetic supplies and insulin medications that can resonate strongly with prospects who have these needs.

Your prospects will also have access to natural health products including CBD alternatives and vitamins with savings up to 75 percent off retail pricing - a compelling selling point for health-conscious individuals.

---- NCE Therapy & Wellness Services ----

When presenting therapy and wellness services, you'll want to emphasize the nature of these benefits.

This includes physical therapy, chiropractic care, speech therapy, and hearing services through extensive provider networks that your prospects can access immediately upon enrollment.

Your members will also get access to nutrition education and wellness programs to support their overall health goals, which appeals to prospects looking for holistic health support.

Remember to mention that National Congress of Employers NCE association benefits are not affiliated with Everest Reinsurance Company. Summit Plan benefits are not dependent on the use of the association's providers. NCE membership is available without purchasing this plan. The benefits listed are not insurance and do not provide coverage, they only provide discounts and services. Benefit discounts and services vary by state. Please note that Aetna Dental Access Network and OUTLOOK Vision Network programs are not available in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington.

---- Summit Plan Options ----

Now let's review the Summit plan options you'll be presenting to prospects. 

You'll be offering eight different plan levels to meet various needs and budgets, ranging from Plan 100 up to Plan 1000 Plus. 

When presenting Hospital Confinement Benefits, you can show prospects the range from one hundred dollars per day on Plan 100 up to one thousand dollars per day on Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus. All plans provide coverage for up to 30 days per confinement and up to 90 days per year.

Intensive Care Unit Benefits mirror the hospital confinement benefits, providing the same daily amounts when your members require intensive care, ensuring they receive maximum financial support during critical times.

Hospital Admission Benefits are exclusive to Plan 1000 Plus, offering prospects a unique one thousand dollar benefit for each hospital admission, with up to 5 admissions covered per year - a significant differentiator for your premium plan.

For Physician Office Visit Benefits, point out this important distinction to prospects. Most plans provide fifty dollars per visit, while Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus increase this to seventy-five dollars per visit. Visit limits vary by plan level - lower plans allow 3 visits per year while Plans 750, 1000, and 1000 Plus allow 5 visits per year.

---- Emergency Room & Diagnostic Testing Benefits ----

Now let's examine 

the emergency room and diagnostic testing benefits that vary by plan level and create excellent upselling opportunities.

Emergency Room Benefits are consistent across most plans at fifty dollars per visit, with Plans 750, 1000, and 1000 Plus providing enhanced coverage at seventy-five to one hundred dollars per visit. All plans allow up to 2 emergency room visits per year, ensuring your prospects have coverage for unexpected medical emergencies.

When presenting diagnostic benefits, explain to prospects that specific plans include coverage for essential medical tests. Plans 200, 200 Plus, 500, 750, 1000, and 1000 Plus provide Laboratory and Diagnostic X-Ray benefits - note that Plan 300 does not include these diagnostic benefits. For these benefits, Plans 200 and 200 Plus allow up to 4 days per year, Plans 500 and 750 allow up to 8 days per year, and Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus allow up to 12 days per year. Notice that Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus offer enhanced coverage at seventy-five to one hundred dollars per day compared to fifty dollars on other plans, giving you a clear value proposition for the premium plans.

Advanced Diagnostic Testing is available on the same plans but with different limits - Plans 500 and higher allow up to 6 days per year while Plans 200 and 200 Plus allow up to 4 days per year. This creates natural upselling opportunities for prospects who may need extensive diagnostic work.

---- Surgery Benefits ----

Now let's examine 

the surgery benefits that represent one of the most significant differentiators in the Summit plan lineup.

Surgery Benefits start with Plan 200 Plus and provide coverage with specific amounts by plan level: Plans 200 Plus and 300 provide two hundred fifty dollars per day, Plan 500 provides three hundred fifty dollars per day, Plan 750 provides four hundred dollars per day, and Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus provide five hundred dollars per day. All surgery plans allow up to 3 procedures per year. An important selling point is the Anesthesia Benefit, which provides an additional twenty-five percent of the surgery benefit amount. This means on Plan 1000, if a prospect has surgery worth five hundred dollars, they'd receive an additional one hundred twenty-five dollars for anesthesia costs.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

As agents, you need to understand the key limitations of Summit plans to properly set expectations with your prospects.

There's a twelve-month exclusion for pre-existing conditions treated before coverage begins.

The main exclusions include treatments that aren't medically necessary, experimental procedures, dental care except for accidents, cosmetic surgery, pregnancy complications, 

self-inflicted injuries, extreme sports, military duty, and work-related injuries covered by Workers' Compensation.

Remember to emphasize that these are fixed indemnity benefits with usage limitations per policy year. 

You should also explain the pre-existing condition definition and all limitations and exclusions. 
 
Always direct members to the complete policy certificate for full details.

---- Key Takeaways for Summit ----

As agents, remember these key takeaways when presenting Summit: 

With eight different plan levels from 100 through 1000 Plus, you can match any prospect's budget and coverage needs.

Hospital Admission Benefits exclusive to Plan 1000 Plus provide a unique selling proposition with one thousand dollars per admission for up to 5 admissions per year, making it an attractive premium option. 

Surgery Benefits starting with Plan 200 Plus, combined with anesthesia benefits at twenty-five percent of the surgical benefit, create excellent upselling opportunities for prospects concerned about potential surgical costs. 

Diagnostic Testing Benefits vary by plan level with Plans 1000 and 1000 Plus offering enhanced coverage, providing clear value propositions for prospects who may need extensive medical testing. 

NCE Association Benefits provide extensive healthcare discounts and services at no extra cost, adding tremendous value beyond the insurance coverage itself. 

And remember, these are fixed indemnity benefits that pay regardless of other insurance coverage your prospects may have, making this an excellent supplement to existing health plans.

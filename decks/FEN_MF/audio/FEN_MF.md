Hello! and thanks for being here! today we're going to be reviewing the MedFirst Plan.

-------------------------------------------  
Introduction & General Information
-------------------------------------------  
MedFirst offers a range of plans designed to help members access healthcare services at controlled costs. All plans utilize the First Health Network for physician services, which is critical for coverage. Some plans include limited indemnity hospital benefits, others provide a set number of physician visits, and all incorporate Preventive Health Services coverage as required under Minimal Essential Coverage guidelines.

-------------------------------------------
Key Common Points
-------------------------------------------
Let's go over some key common points:
- All sickness benefits have a 30-day waiting period before becoming payable.  
- Members must use in-network providers (First Health Network) for physician services.  
- Inpatient hospital indemnity benefits (when offered) are not restricted to in-network providers.  
- Preventive benefits must be received at outpatient facilities, not in a hospital.  
- Prescription coverage varies by plan, often involving discount programs, specific formularies, copay tiers, and, in some plans, a Prescription Assistance Program for certain medications.  
- Telemedicine services through Kindly Human/Recuro Health are included across all plans with no maximum visit limits, and typically no consult fees. This helps control costs for certain physician services.  
- Healthcare Ninja, when included, is an advocacy tool to reduce healthcare costs and can be used after certain plan benefits are exhausted.

-------------------------------------------
Required Verbiage & Disclosures
-------------------------------------------
Whenever you see numbers or footnotes next to a listed benefit, it corresponds to mandatory disclosures or verbiage that must be reviewed with the client. Ensure this is communicated properly during enrollment.

-------------------------------------------  
Preventive Health Services  
-------------------------------------------  
All MedFirst plans include Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) preventive health services, following U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. For each preventive service:  
- **Benefit**: Describes what the service is (e.g., screenings, counseling).  
- **Interval**: States how often the service can be used (e.g., annually, once per lifetime).  
- **Requirements**: Indicates age groups, lifestyle factors, or other conditions that must be met (e.g., certain screenings only for men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked).

-------------------------------------------
Preventative Services Overview
-------------------------------------------

As you guys can see, the list is extensive, but it is a comprehensive list of preventative services.

-------------------------------------------  
Immunizations  
-------------------------------------------  

Immunizations are also covered as recommended by the CDC and are grouped by age bracketsâ€”birth through 6 years old, 7 through 18 years old, and 19 years or older. Always verify the age group before quoting a covered benefit.

Make sure to cover exclusions with clients and check eligibility before quoting.

Closing Reminders  
------------------------------------------- 

Here are some things to remember when talking about the MedFirst plans:
- Always discuss required footnotes or verbiage associated with numbered benefits.  
- Ensure clients understand in-network requirements, waiting periods, and formulary restrictions.  
- Reinforce that Best Choice RX Group programs are not stand-alone prescription drug plans; coverage and costs depend on formulary, brand/generic status, and other factors.  
- Telemedicine and Healthcare Ninja services are designed to help reduce out-of-pocket costs and should be explained thoroughly.  
- Most importantly, remain compliant, thorough, and caring. Help clients understand their options and maintain clarity about their coverage.

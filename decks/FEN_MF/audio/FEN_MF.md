Hello and thanks for being here! today we're going to be reviewing the MedFirst Plan.

---- Introduction & General Information ----

MedFirst offers a range of plans designed to help members access healthcare services at controlled costs. All plans utilize the First Health Network for physician services, which is critical for coverage. Some plans include limited indemnity hospital benefits, others provide a set number of physician visits, and all incorporate Preventive Health Services coverage as required under Minimal Essential Coverage guidelines.

---- Key Common Points ----

Let's go over some key common points:
- All sickness benefits have a 30-day waiting period before becoming payable.  
- Members must use in-network providers (First Health Network) for physician services.  
- Inpatient hospital indemnity benefits (when offered) are not restricted to in-network providers.  
- Preventive benefits must be received at outpatient facilities, not in a hospital.  
- Prescription coverage varies by plan, often involving discount programs, specific formularies, copay tiers, and, in some plans, a Prescription Assistance Program for certain medications.  
- Telemedicine services through kindly human and Recuro Health are included across all plans with no maximum visit limits, and typically no consult fees. This helps control costs for certain physician services.  
- Healthcare Ninja, when included, is an advocacy tool to reduce healthcare costs and can be used after certain plan benefits are exhausted.

---- Required Verbiage & Disclosures ----

Remember, whenever you see numbers or footnotes next to a listed benefit, it corresponds to mandatory disclosures or verbiage that must be reviewed with the client. Ensure this is communicated properly during enrollment.

---- Preventive Health Services ----

All MedFirst plans include Minimum Essential Coverage preventive health services, following U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. For each preventive service, benefit describes what the service is. For example, screenings or counseling. Interval states how often the service can be used. For example, annually or once per lifetime. Requirements indicates age groups, lifestyle factors, or other conditions that must be met. For example, certain screenings only for men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked.

---- Preventative Services Overview ----

As you can see, this is the full list of preventative services.

---- Immunizations ----

Immunizations are also covered as recommended by the CDC and are grouped by age bracketsâ€”birth through 6 years old, 7 through 18 years old, and 19 years or older. Always verify the age group before quoting a covered benefit.

Make sure to cover exclusions with clients and check eligibility before quoting.

---- MedFirst Wellness Plan ----

Let's start with our entry-level option, the MedFirst Wellness Plan. Let me walk you through each component.

For physician services, members receive one annual wellness exam with a $25 copay, up to a $150 maximum benefit. Like all our plans, you'll need to use First Health Network providers, and benefits are subject to a 30-day waiting period.

When it comes to telemedicine, we've made sure you have great access to care. Members get unlimited visits through kindly human and Recuro Health with no consult fees. This is a valuable benefit you'll find across all our MedFirst plans, making it easy to get care when you need it.

For prescriptions, we work with the Best Choice RX Group Discount Program. Now, I want to be very clear here - this is a discount program, not a prescription drug plan. What this means is that members receive varying discounts at participating pharmacies, but there aren't set copays.

One important note about this plan - it does not include any hospital coverage. This makes it ideal for those primarily seeking preventive care and basic medical services.

---- MedFirst 1 Plan ----

Now let's look at our MedFirst 1 Plan, which adds several important benefits to the Wellness Plan foundation.

For physician services, we've expanded the coverage significantly. Members now get three primary care visits per year with a $25 copay and up to $150 maximum per visit. We've also added specialist and urgent care coverage, providing one visit annually with a $50 copay, up to $300 maximum. As always, you'll need to use the First Health Network for these services.

This plan introduces hospital coverage. Members receive $1,000 per day up to $5000 per year. I do need to point out that there's a 12-month waiting period for any pre-existing conditions.

Your telemedicine benefit continues unchanged, giving you those valuable unlimited visits with no consult fees through kindly human and Recuro Health.

The RX coverage is the same as the Wellness Plan, which is a discount program, not a prescription drug plan.

We've also added something special to this plan - our Healthcare Ninja advocacy benefit. This valuable service helps members manage their healthcare costs, especially when primary benefits are exhausted.

---- MedFirst 2 Plan ----

Moving up to our MedFirst 2 Plan, we've made several updates to serve our members' needs.

Let's start with physician services. We've increased the number of visits available. Now you'll get four primary care visits per year, still with that same $25 copay and $150 maximum per visit. For specialist and urgent care, we've increased the visits to two per year, keeping the $50 copay and $300 maximum. Remember, these services must be through our First Health Network providers.

For hospital coverage, we've doubled the annual maximum to $10,000 while maintaining that $1,000 daily benefit. As with Plan 1, there's a 12-month waiting period for pre-existing conditions.

Your telemedicine benefit remains the same with unlimited visits and no consult fees.

Now, here's where we see an upgrade - the prescription coverage. With the enhanced Best Choice RX program, you'll get:
- No cost for preventive and acute generic medications
- Just a $5 copay for 200 maintenance generic drugs
- Flexible options with both 30-day retail and 90-day mail-order available
- No monthly maximum for drugs on our formulary
- Access to our Prescription Assistance Program if you qualify based on income

The Healthcare Ninja advocacy service is available to help manage healthcare costs.

---- MedFirst 3 Plan ----

With our MedFirst 3 Plan, we've created an even more robust package of benefits.

Looking at physician services, we've kept the four primary care visits per year with the same $25 copay and $150 maximum. But here's what's exciting - we've doubled your specialist and urgent care visits to four per year, maintaining the $50 copay and $300 maximum. This gives you more flexibility in accessing specialized care when you need it.

For hospital coverage, we've increased your annual maximum to $15000 while keeping that same $1000 daily benefit. As with all our plans, please remember the 12-month waiting period for pre-existing conditions.

Your telemedicine access remains comprehensive with unlimited $0 consult visits through kindly human and Recuro Health.

The prescription coverage gets even better with our Best Choice RX Plus Plan. You'll keep all the generic benefits from Plan 2, but now we've added:
- Coverage for brand medications with prior authorization
- Tiered copays for non-preferred generics starting at just $5
- 90-day mail order options for greater convenience
- A monthly limit of $150 for non-preventive medications

The Healthcare Ninja advocacy benefit continues to be there to help you navigate your healthcare journey.

---- MedFirst 4 Plan - 1 of 2 ----

Our MedFirst 4 Plan introduces some exciting new benefits while building on everything you've seen so far.

For physician services, we've created a comprehensive package that includes:
- An annual wellness exam with a $25 copay and $150 maximum
- Four primary care visits, now with a $50 copay and $150 maximum
- Four specialist or urgent care visits with a $75 copay and $300 maximum
All of these services are available through our First Health Network providers.

The hospital benefits really shine in this plan. You'll receive:
- A higher daily benefit of $1500, up to $15000 annually
- Coverage for both inpatient and outpatient surgery at $1500 per day, up to $2000 per year
- Emergency room coverage of $1000 per incident when admitted
- Ambulance coverage of $500 per incident when admitted
Remember, these benefits have a 12-month waiting period for pre-existing conditions.

---- MedFirst 4 Plan - 2 of 2 ----

Your telemedicine benefit continues to provide unlimited access to kindly human and Recuro Health with no consult fees.

The prescription coverage maintains the comprehensive structure from Plan 3, with all the same benefits including generic and brand coverage, mail order options, and that $150 monthly limit for non-preventive drugs.

And of course, you'll still have access to our Healthcare Ninja advocacy service.

---- MedFirst 5 Plan - 1 of 2 ----

Finally, let me introduce our premium offering - the MedFirst 5 Plan. This is our most comprehensive coverage option.

For physician services, we've increased your access even further:
- Keep your annual wellness exam with the $25 copay and $150 maximum
- Now get five primary care visits with the $50 copay and $150 maximum
- Also five specialist or urgent care visits with the $75 copay and $300 maximum
As always, these services are available through our First Health Network providers.

The hospital benefits are similar to Plan 4, but with one important upgrade:
- You'll still get that $1500 daily benefit up to $15000 annually
- But now your surgery coverage increases to $4500 per year
- You keep the same ER and ambulance benefits
- And yes, the 12-month pre-existing condition waiting period still applies

---- MedFirst 5 Plan - 2 of 2 ----

Your telemedicine benefit remains unchanged, with unlimited visits with no consult fees through kindly human and Recuro Health.

The prescription coverage continues with all the comprehensive benefits from Plan 4, including the same copay structure and monthly limits.

And of course, the Healthcare Ninja advocacy benefit is still there to help you maximize your healthcare dollars.

This plan represents our highest level of coverage, perfect for those seeking maximum protection and flexibility in their healthcare choices.

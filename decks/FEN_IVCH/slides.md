2. **Managing General Agent (MGA) / Managing General Underwriter (MGU)**
3. **Third-Party Administrator (TPA)**
4. **Field Marketing Organization (FMO) / National Marketing Organization (NMO)**
5. **Independent Marketing Organization (IMO) / Brokerage General Agency (BGA)**
6. **Insurance Agency / Aggregator / Cluster Group**
7. **Independent Insurance Agent / Broker**

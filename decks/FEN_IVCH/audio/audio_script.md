Hello! Thank you for joining today's training session on the Insurance Value Chain Hierarchy. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to the Insurance Value Chain Hierarchy ----

Welcome to our session on the Insurance Value Chain Hierarchy.

Our objective today is to explore what it is and understand its importance in the insurance industry.

---- What is the Insurance Value Chain Hierarchy? ----

The Insurance Value Chain Hierarchy represents the players involved in the insurance chain, from the entity at the top that takes on the actual risk, down to the individual agents who sell the policies.

It covers the following entities in top-down order: Insurance Carrier or Underwriter, Managing General Agent or Managing General Underwriter, Third-Party Administrator, Field Marketing Organization or National Marketing Organization, Independent Marketing Organization or Brokerage General Agency, Insurance Agency or Aggregator or Cluster Group, and Independent Insurance Agent or Broker.

---- Insurance Carrier / Underwriter ----

The Insurance Carrier is the risk-bearing entity at the top of the hierarchy that designs and underwrites insurance policies.

Their core functions include product creation, risk underwriting, claims payment, and regulatory compliance.

Examples include Zurich, Ambetter, and Aetna, earning revenue from policyholder premiums.

---- Managing General Agent / Managing General Underwriter ----

M G As and M G Us are specialized intermediaries with delegated authority to underwrite and price policies on behalf of carriers, typically for niche markets or specialized products.

Core functions include underwriting policies, managing distribution channels, and product development.

They earn commissions from carriers, with examples like Ryan Specialty Group and AmWINS Program Underwriters.

---- Third-Party Administrator ----

T P As are outsourced service providers for policy administration and claims handling, working with carriers without assuming risk.

Their services include claims processing, billing, enrollment, and customer service for carriers, M G As, or self-funded employer groups.

Examples include FirstEnroll for billing and AdminOne for claims processing, earning service fees.

---- Field Marketing Organization / National Marketing Organization ----

F M Os and N M Os are large-scale distribution partners that recruit and support independent agents, primarily in life and health insurance.

They provide agent training, compliance guidance, and negotiate carrier contracts, but do not have underwriting authority.

An example is Sonic Marketing, earning overrides from carrier commissions.

---- Insurance Marketing Organization / Brokerage General Agent ----

I M Os and B G As are similar to F M Os but more product-focused, specializing in life, annuities, and specialty insurance.

They provide marketing support, sales tools, and carrier access to independent agents without underwriting authority.

Examples include Sicuro Health and Synergy Insurance Affiliates, earning overrides from carriers.

---- Insurance Agency / Aggregator / Cluster Group ----

Agencies are retail-level organizations where agents gain carrier access and higher commission levels through grouping.

They handle direct sales, client servicing, and compliance support, and can be either captive or independent.

Examples include Bridgewater Health Insurance Agency and Cornerstone Insurance Agency, earning commissions.

---- Independent Insurance Agent / Broker ----

Independent Agents and Brokers are the frontline professionals selling insurance directly to consumers and businesses.

Their core functions include prospecting, selling policies, advising clients, and servicing existing policies.

They earn commissions from carriers or the organizations they contract through.

---- Compliance Overview ----

Compliance is following the laws, regulations, and industry standards that govern how insurance companies, agents, and intermediaries operate. Each entity in the value chain has specific compliance responsibilities and accountable parties.

---- Compliance: Insurance Carrier ----

Independent Agents bear full personal responsibility for their compliance.

Core functions include maintaining licenses and C E, adhering to insurer guidelines, proper disclosures, and avoiding U D A A P practices.

The individual agent is fully responsible for their own compliance.

---- Licensing and Contracting Overview ----

Licensing is the legal permission given by a state's Department of Insurance, or D O I, that allows a person or business to sell insurance. Contracting is the business agreement you sign with an insurance carrier, F M O or I M O, or M G A that lets you sell their specific insurance products and earn commissions.

Members identified as the primary account holder can cancel their membership by calling a toll-free number or by sending a signed cancellation notice to the specified address or email. If cancellation occurs within thirty days of signing up, the first month's paid membership fee will be refunded. However, cancellation notifications must be received at least one business day prior to the monthly recurring charge date to avoid automatic membership continuation and fee collection.\n\nThe page also includes a section where members must enter their Membership ID, Name, and Sign to accept the payment terms and conditions. Additionally, it contains a statement that the membership is not a health insurance policy and does not replace one. It is also not a Qualified Health Plan under the Affordable Care Act. Members authorize the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and other relevant information to entities involved in providing payment, treatment, or services.\n\nThe document emphasizes that the membership agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the member and Health Access Options, superseding any other representations or agreements.",

      "summary": "This page outlines several key features and provisions related to the Health Access Options (HAO) plan, focusing on the Prescription Savings Program (PSP) and Telemedicine Services. The PSP allows eligible members to pay a monthly administrative service fee for individual or family membership. Members are responsible for pricing as discussed in voice-recorded verification upon pharmaceutical manufacturer approval. HAO is not affiliated with pharmaceutical companies and does not dispense medications. Identification and documentation may be required for each application.\n\nTelemedicine Services are also detailed, emphasizing that telemedicine does not replace primary care physicians and prescriptions are not guaranteed. Telemedicine partners adhere to state regulations and do not prescribe certain drugs due to potential abuse. Co-pays for telemedicine benefits are paid directly to partners.\n\nThe page includes disclaimers stating that HAO is not an insurer or healthcare service underwriter. Membership features and benefits may change, and HAO disclaims liability for professional services rendered by providers. Limitations of liability are clearly stated, emphasizing that HAO is not liable for damages related to professional services.",

It includes a disclaimer of liability for special, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, emphasizing that the provider is not responsible for any loss of profits, revenue, or use arising from the service. The indemnification clause requires members to indemnify and hold harmless the provider from all claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising from the use or misuse of the provider's products or services.\n\nThe governing law section specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Florida, with provisions for severability to ensure the validity of the agreement even if parts are deemed unenforceable. The miscellaneous section includes an arbitration clause, mandating that disputes be resolved through binding arbitration in Palm Beach County, Florida, under the American Arbitration Association's rules. It also states that each party bears its own costs, and no class arbitration is allowed.\n\nAdditionally, the page mentions that any damages, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees incurred by the provider, must be paid by the member. It specifies that no action may be brought by either party more than one year after the membership's effective date.",

include no coverage for pre-existing conditions and waiting periods for some services.\n\nTerms and conditions are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, with an arbitration clause for disputes.\n\nThe cancellation policy allows refunds within thirty days of signing up, with ongoing billing terms.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\nThe plan offers flexibility with a range of services to suit different needs.\n\nIt balances cost versus coverage, providing affordability with access to essential services.\n\nNext steps

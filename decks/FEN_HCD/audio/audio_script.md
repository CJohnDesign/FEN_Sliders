---- What is a Plan Sponsor? ----

Let's begin with understanding what a Plan Sponsor is. 

Plan Sponsors are entities that provide health insurance plans or other benefits directly to their members, employees, or participants. 

They offer benefits directly to members

administer their own benefits programs

serve employees or participants and

manage organizational benefits

---- How Plan Sponsors Work ----

let me explain how Plan Sponsors operate. 

They offer health insurance plans directly to members and 

provide wellness programs. 

A plan sponsor manages the insurance plan in-house or 

through third-party administrators. 

They design and implement customized benefits that meet their specific needs.

---- Plan Sponsor Characteristics ----

Let's examine the key characteristics of Plan Sponsors. 

First, they provide and manage health benefits directly for their members or employees. 

Second, they often design and customize plans to fit specific organizational needs. 

Finally, they may be self-funded, meaning they pay claims directly, 

or insured, where they purchase coverage from an insurance company.

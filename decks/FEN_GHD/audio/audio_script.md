Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on Good Health Distribution Partner Sponsor. We'll explore what plan sponsors are, how they work, and the valuable benefits Good Health offers to its members.

---- What is a Plan Sponsor? ----

Let's begin with understanding what a Plan Sponsor is. 

Plan Sponsors are entities that provide health insurance plans or other benefits directly to their members, employees, or participants. 

They offer benefits directly to members

administer their own benefits programs

serve employees or participants 

and manage organizational benefits

---- How Plan Sponsors Work ----

Now, let me explain how Plan Sponsors operate. 

They offer health insurance plans directly to members and 

provide wellness programs. 

A plan sponsor manages the insurance plan in-house or 

through third-party administrators. 

They design and implement customized benefits that meet their specific needs.

---- Plan Sponsor Characteristics ----

Let's examine the key characteristics of Plan Sponsors. 

First, they provide and manage health benefits directly for their members or employees. 

Second, they often design and customize plans to fit specific organizational needs. 

Finally, they may be self-funded, meaning they pay claims directly, 

or insured, where they purchase coverage from an insurance company.

---- Plan Sponsor & Relationship ----

Before we discuss plan benefits with clients, there's required information we must cover with them.

Members must become an Affiliate Marketer of Good Health Distribution Partners. 

While not required to sell, this affiliation allows members to share the brand and refer others to become Affiliates.

As an Ambassador, they can receive compensation, 

and as an Affiliate, they receive health benefits that we'll cover in the Plan Overview.

---- Membership Benefits ----

Let's explore the key membership benefits in three important categories. 

As an Official Good Health Distribution Partner Affiliate, they'll have business opportunities and product access. 

Through their Benefit Programs, members get Health Benefits access and our Get Well and Stay Well programs.

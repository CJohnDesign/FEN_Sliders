Manage Care Reference Based Pricing – MBR’s support team of medical professionals utilized the newest method of medical cost containment, “Reference Based Pricing.” Reference Based Pricing is a system of paying providers based on 150% - 200% percentage of “Medicare Allowable Rates”. Most doctors will accept this formular as total payment for their services. This allows members to choose their own doctor. Members are not required to go only to a network provider.	Included In Both Plans
Advocacy Service - Concierge Service will assist members to understand their benefits and how to use them. MBR Advocacy professionals will also help members file their insurance claims and Advocates will negotiate with providers to reduce the balance due on bills after insurance payments. If there is a balance, Advocacy Concierge Service will help members setup payment plans with providers or negotiate to eliminate balance owed entirely.	Included In Both Plans

---- Introduction ----

Welcome to this tutorial on using the Multiplan provider search website. I'll guide you through the process of finding a healthcare provider step by step.

---- Getting Started ----

Most Member ID cards contain a specific web address for provider search. This card displays 

Value Point by MultiPlan. If this information is unavailable, members can still locate the correct Provider Network following these steps.

---- Finding the Provider Search ----

After signing onto the web page, members should select Find a Provider. From there, they should select the network shown on the member's ID card with the Multiplan Logo. For example, if the essential care plan member ID card states Value Point by MultiPlan, this indicates that Value Point is under the Multiplan Network. members should select Value Point as shown on the card. Next, members can enter their search criteria. Clicking in the search box will display a drop-down menu to select the provider type, or members may type in a specific physician's name. For this example, "hospital" will be used as the provider type. members then enter the member's zip code and click on the search icon. The search results will populate a list of available providers. members can click on any provider to view their detailed information.

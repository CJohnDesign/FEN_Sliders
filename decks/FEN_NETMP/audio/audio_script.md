---- Introduction ----

Welcome to this tutorial on using the Multiplan provider search website. I'll guide you through the process of finding a healthcare provider step by step.

---- Getting Started ----

Most Member ID cards will have a specific web address for provider search. Notice the card states Value Point by MultiPlan.

If this information is unavailable members can still locate the correct Provider Network following this process.

---- Finding the Provider Search ----

Once we've signed on to the web page, we are going to select Find a Provider.

From there, we're going to select the network on the members ID with the Multiplan Logo.

For example, on our essential care plan member ID card, it states Value Point by MultiPlan.

This indicates that Value Point is under the Multiplan Network.

So we're going to select Value Point.

As we saw on the card.

We're now going to enter in our search criteria.

If you click in the box, it will allow a drop down box to formulate and you can select the provider type or if you'd like, you can type in the physician's name.

So in this example, we are going to use hospital.

Next We're going to enter in member's zip code.

And then we'll click on the search icon.

Once you click on the search icon, it will populate a list of providers that are available for you and you can click on the providers available to get the provider details.

This will conclude your Multiplan provider search. Thank you for participating in First Enroll's Training and continue to be great!!

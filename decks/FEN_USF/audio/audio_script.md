Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the MyChoice Plan. We'll walk through the plan's comprehensive benefits, explain how it helps control healthcare costs, and discuss how membership through the Business Workers of America (BWA) makes these benefits possible.

---- MyChoice Plan Overview ----

The MyChoice Plan offers hospital indemnity insurance through Business Workers of America (BWA), providing flexible coverage for various medical situations. This comprehensive plan includes extensive benefits and support tools designed to help members navigate their healthcare journey effectively. One of its key advantages is significant cost savings through medical bill repricing, along with extensive support to help members understand and maximize their benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Hospital Admission Benefits give members financial support when they're admitted to a hospital. ICU Confinement Benefits provide an additional layer of protection for intensive care stays. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement Benefits extend coverage for multiple days. Certain plans include Surgical and Ambulance Benefits for more comprehensive protection. Prescription Savings Programs through HealthWarehouse help members save on medications.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Medical Bill Repricing (MBR) negotiates hospital and medical bills on behalf of members, lowering out-of-pocket expenses. A Reference-Based Pricing System ensures fair and competitive rates from healthcare providers. Financial Assistance Guidance helps members handle billing issues and navigate the payment process.

---- How MBR Works ----

Members enroll through BWA and then seek healthcare services as needed. Medical bills are submitted to MBR, and after negotiation, members receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The final step is paying the reduced balance, simplifying the process and providing valuable cost savings.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Annual Wellness Exams help detect health issues early. Preventive Screenings address potential risks before they become serious. DirectLabs makes it straightforward for members to obtain recommended lab tests without hassle.

---- Telehealth Services ----

24/7 Virtual Doctor Visits allow access to healthcare providers anytime, avoiding inconvenient clinic appointments. No Consultation Fees mean members can consult a doctor as often as needed. This service is both convenient and efficient, and it can also provide necessary prescriptions.

---- Advocacy and Support Services ----

Concierge-style healthcare advocacy guides members through provider selection and explains plan benefits. There's support for finding financial assistance options if needed. Additionally, the plan offers help throughout the claims process to reduce confusion and stress.

---- MyChoice Low Plan (One of Two) ----

Let's examine the Low Plan's hospital benefits first. It provides one hundred dollars per day for Hospital Confinement and two hundred dollars for ICU Confinement. There's a generous First Day Hospital Admission benefit of one thousand dollars, and the Hospital Benefits Year Maximum is set at one million dollars. For emergency services, the plan includes a two hundred dollar Emergency Room benefit and both ground and air ambulance coverage at one hundred dollars each. Outpatient care includes a fifty dollar benefit for both office visits and wellness visits, with a Calendar Year Maximum of four thousand dollars.

---- MyChoice Low Plan (Two of Two) ----

The Low Plan includes important plan limits and features. There's a substantial Lifetime Maximum of five million dollars, and pre-existing conditions are subject to a twelve/twelve limitation. This means that any condition you had in the twelve months before your coverage starts won't be covered for the first twelve months of your plan. The plan includes portability, allowing members to maintain coverage even after leaving their employer. While this plan provides essential coverage, it does not include surgical benefits.

---- MyChoice Mid Plan (One of Two) ----

The Mid Plan enhances hospital benefits significantly. Hospital Confinement increases to three hundred dollars per day, and ICU Confinement rises to five hundred dollars per day. It maintains the same one thousand dollar First Day Hospital Admission benefit and one million dollar Hospital Benefits Year Maximum. Emergency services include the same two hundred dollar Emergency Room benefit, with ground ambulance at one hundred dollars and increased air ambulance coverage at two hundred dollars. Outpatient care remains consistent with fifty dollar benefits for both office and wellness visits, maintaining the four thousand dollar Calendar Year Maximum.

---- MyChoice Mid Plan (Two of Two) ----

Like the Low Plan, the Mid Plan features a five million dollar Lifetime Maximum and the same twelve/twelve pre-existing conditions limitation. Portability is included, and while this plan offers enhanced hospital benefits, it also does not include surgical coverage.

---- MyChoice High Plan (One of Two) ----

The High Plan maintains the Mid Plan's enhanced hospital benefits of three hundred dollars per day for Hospital Confinement and five hundred dollars for ICU Confinement, along with the one thousand dollar First Day Hospital Admission and one million dollar Hospital Benefits Year Maximum. Emergency services include the standard two hundred dollar Emergency Room benefit, one hundred dollar ground ambulance, and an increased air ambulance benefit of three hundred dollars. What sets this plan apart, is its comprehensive surgical benefits package, which includes one Surgical Schedule, five hundred dollar Ambulatory Outpatient Facility benefit, and both Assistant Surgeon and Anesthesia cover one Surgical Schedule.

---- MyChoice High Plan (Two of Two) ----

For outpatient care, the High Plan increases the office visit benefit to seventy-five dollars while maintaining the fifty dollar wellness visit benefit and four thousand dollar Calendar Year Maximum. The plan includes a five million dollar Lifetime Maximum and thesame twelve/twelve pre-existing conditions limitation. Portability is included, making this the most comprehensive plan option with its addition of surgical benefits.

---- Comparing the 3 MyChoice Plans ----

The Low Plan provides basic Hospital and ICU Confinement benefits with standard office visit coverage. The Mid Plan increases hospital benefits and Air Ambulance coverage. The High Plan offers the most comprehensive coverage, including increased office visit benefits and surgical coverage, plus the highest Air Ambulance benefit.

---- Definitions and Limitations ----

Let me highlight the key limitations of each benefit category. For hospital benefits, there's a ten-day maximum per stay for both regular rooms and ICU. Emergency Room coverage is limited to one visit per day.

Surgical benefits follow a set schedule that determines payment amounts for procedures, anesthesia, and assistant surgeons. All surgical benefits are subject to the calendar year maximum.

For doctor visits, the plan allows up to three office visits and one wellness visit per year. Note that office and wellness benefits cannot be combined for the same visit.

Finally, understand that pre-existing conditions have a twelve-month waiting period, portability is available after six months of coverage, and all coverage ends at age seventy. Please review these details carefully with your clients.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

MBR Services can help significantly reduce members' medical bills. Telemedicine and Prescription Savings are standard features. Preventive Care and Wellness benefits are designed to keep members healthier in the long run. Finally, remember that BWA membership is required to access these plan benefits.

The insurance covers hospital admission, ER admission, hospital confinement, and physician office visits, totaling $3,175 in benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the slide outlines the flexibility of using these benefits for various needs, such as medical copays, deductibles, transportation, child care, and housekeeping.

---- Accident Medical Expense AME Benefits ----

Now let's review the Accident Medical Expense benefits, or A M E benefits, that your prospects will find especially valuable when facing unexpected medical costs from covered accidents.

A M E benefits reimburse covered medical expenses incurred due to a covered accident, providing essential financial protection when accidents result in hospital bills and treatment costs.

You'll have two plan options to offer your prospects. Plan Option 1 provides five thousand dollars in A M E benefits, while Plan Option 2 provides ten thousand dollars in A M E benefits. Both plans feature a two hundred fifty dollar deductible that must be met before benefits are payable.

Both plans use excess coverage, meaning they pay after other insurance has been applied, and the first covered expenses must be incurred within ninety days of the covered accident.

It's important to explain to prospects that benefits are only payable for usual and customary charges incurred after the deductible has been met, for medically necessary covered expenses incurred within three hundred sixty-five days of the covered accident.

---- Summit AD&D A M E Plan Coverage Amounts ----

Now let's examine 

the two plan levels providing Principal Sum amounts for member and family coverage.

Two plan levels give you flexibility to meet your prospect's budget and coverage needs with both offering ten thousand dollars in member coverage. When presenting Member coverage, you can show prospects that both plans provide ten thousand dollars in protection for accidental death or dismemberment.

The first option, Summit AD&D Plan ten thousand five thousand, provides spouse coverage at five thousand dollars and dependent children coverage at twenty-five hundred dollars.

The second option, Summit AD&D Plan ten thousand ten thousand, provides spouse coverage at ten thousand dollars and dependent children coverage at twenty-five hundred dollars, ensuring enhanced family protection.

---- Important Definitions ----

Now let's examine some of the AD&D policy definitions you need to understand and communicate to prospects.

Accident or Accidental means a sudden, unexpected, unintended or unforeseen event, definite as to time and place, that is the direct cause of an Accidental Injury to a Covered Person.

Accidental Injury means bodily injury to a Covered Person that is directly caused by an Accident which is independent of Sickness and not excluded under the Policy.

Now let's examine the key definitions and coverage criteria for A M E benefits that you need to understand and communicate to prospects.

A Covered Accident means a sudden, unforeseeable external event that results, directly and independently of all other causes, in a Covered Injury or Covered Loss and meets all the following conditions:

The accident must occur while the Covered Person is insured under the Rider, cannot be contributed to by disease, sickness, or mental or bodily infirmity, and must not be otherwise excluded under the terms of the Rider.

It's crucial to explain to prospects that Accident Medical Expense Benefits are only payable for Usual and Customary charges incurred after the Deductible has been met, for those Medically Necessary Covered Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Covered Person, and for Covered Expenses incurred within three hundred sixty-five days after the date of the Covered Accident. No benefits will be paid for any expenses incurred that are in excess of Usual and Customary charges.


---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

As agents, you need to understand the key limitations of Summit AD&D A M E to properly set expectations with your prospects.

There's a maximum of one dismemberment benefit per Covered Person per Accident, regardless of how many losses occur in the same incident.

Benefits are only payable if dismemberment occurs within three hundred sixty-five days of the accident, emphasizing the importance of timely medical treatment.

For A M E benefits specifically, remember that the two hundred fifty dollar deductible must be met before A M E benefits are payable.

First covered expenses must be incurred within ninety days of the covered accident.

The main exclusions include self-inflicted injuries, suicide, and intoxication-related incidents.

Additional exclusions include war, military service, and aviation except as a fare-paying passenger on commercial flights.

Remember to emphasize that Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits are separate from other insurance coverage and pay based on the specific loss sustained. You should explain that only one dismemberment benefit is payable per accident, and all accidents must be definite as to time and place and independent of sickness or disease.
 
Always direct members to the complete policy certificate for full details.

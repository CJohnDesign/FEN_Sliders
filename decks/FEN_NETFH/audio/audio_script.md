---- Introduction ----

Welcome to this tutorial on using the First Health provider search website. I'll guide you through the process of finding a healthcare provider step by step.

---- Accessing the Search ----

Let's begin with heading to the site. Locate and click on the "Locate a Provider" button. Under network options, select "First Health Network," and then click the "Start Now" button to begin your provider search.

Now, let's set up your search criteria. First, select your provider type. In this demonstration, we'll choose "Physician" as our provider type. Make sure to check the "Accepting New Patients" option to ensure provider availability. You can search using either a ZIP code or state, but I recommend using a ZIP code for more precise results. You can adjust the search radius up to 100 miles from your location.

For more specific results, click on "More Options." This opens additional search criteria that allow you to break down provider searches in greater detail. Take a moment to review and select any specific requirements you may have for your provider.

After entering all your search criteria, click the "Search Now" button. The system will generate a list of providers matching your specifications. To view detailed information about a specific provider, simply click on their name in the results list.

On the provider details page, you'll find comprehensive information that the provider has chosen to share. This may include their specialties, office hours, and contact information. Notice the convenient sharing options available to you.

A helpful feature is the ability to share provider information. You can send the details to yourself via email or text message. To use this feature, click either the email or telephone option, enter your contact information, and click "Verify and Send." The system will then send you the provider's details for future reference.

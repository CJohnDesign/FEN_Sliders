---- Introduction ----

Welcome to this tutorial on using the Multiplan provider search website. I'll guide you through the process of finding a healthcare provider in the Multiplan network.

---- Locating the Search ----

Before we begin, note that most Member ID cards will have a specific web address for provider search. Even if this information isn't available, you can still locate the correct Provider Network using the process I'll show you today.

---- Accessing the Network ----

Once you've accessed the web page, locate and click on the "Find a Provider" button. Next, you'll need to select the network shown on your member ID card with the Multiplan Logo. For example, if you have the essential care plan, your member ID card will show "Value Point by MultiPlan." This indicates that Value Point is under the Multiplan Network, so we'll select "Value Point" as shown on the card.

---- Setting Search Criteria ----

Now let's enter our search criteria. Click in the search box to see a dropdown menu of provider types, or you can directly type in a physician's name if you're looking for someone specific. For this demonstration, we'll select "hospital" as our provider type. Next, enter your ZIP code to find providers in your area.

---- Performing the Search ----

After entering your search criteria, locate the search icon. Before the search begins, you'll need to verify that you're not a robot by checking the appropriate box. Once you've done this, click the search icon to proceed.

---- Viewing Results ----

The system will generate a list of providers available in your area. To view more detailed information about any provider, simply click on their name in the results list. This will show you their complete provider details.

---- Additional Features ----

Take a moment to explore the provider details page. Here you'll find important information about the facility or physician, including contact information, specialties, and other relevant details that can help you make an informed decision.

Members can choose from multiple tiers ranging from one hundred A to one thousand, ensuring they select a plan that best fits their healthcare needs. Eligibility is open to adult members aged eighteen to sixty-five and dependent children aged one to twenty-five.

The simplified claims process allows for easy submission through electronic or mail options to International Benefits Administrators. Support services include a twenty-four/seven health information line and nurse helpline, offering immediate assistance and health guidance.

---- Plan Tiers and Benefits ----

Now, let's delve into the plan tiers. Each tier offers different levels of coverage with specific benefits and limitations. For instance, the hospital confinement benefit provides coverage per day that increases from one hundred dollars at the one hundred A tier, up to one thousand dollars at the one thousand tier, with a maximum coverage of thirty days for all tiers. The primary care doctors' office visit benefit offers fifty dollars per day for all tiers except the one thousand, which provides seventy-five dollars, with varying maximum days per tier. Similarly, the specialty care doctors' office visit benefit also varies, with coverage per day increasing at higher tiers.

---- Comparing the Plans ----

When comparing the plans, you'll notice that each tier offers unique benefits. For example, hospital confinement coverage per day increases across tiers from one hundred dollars in the one hundred A tier to one thousand dollars in the one thousand tier. Similarly, primary care visit coverage and specialty care visit coverage follow this pattern, providing members with choices that align with their healthcare needs and financial preferences.

---- Definitions and Limitations ----

It's important to be aware of certain exclusions. Benefits do not cover non-medically necessary treatments, experimental procedures, services by family members, elective surgeries, or pre-existing conditions within the first twelve months. A pre-existing condition is defined as any condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received during the twelve months before the coverage effective date. The waiting period is a thirty-day timeframe post-coverage effective date during which benefits are not payable for sickness, though injuries are excluded from this waiting period.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

To wrap up, the Advanced Wellness Plus Plan offers diverse coverage options to fit various healthcare needs and preferences. Its competitive benefit packages are designed to effectively supplement existing high-deductible major medical plans.

Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Paramount Plan. We'll walk through the plan's benefits. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to the Paramount Plan ----

The Paramount Plan, underwritten by BCS Insurance Company, provides 

flexible coverage for various medical situations. 

It combines hospital indemnity benefits with extensive support tools to help members navigate their healthcare journey. 

Membership is available through the Business Workers of America, which we'll refer to as BWA from now on, granting access to these exclusive benefits.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let's explore the key features. 

Hospital Admission Benefits provide financial support when members are admitted to a hospital. 

Intensive Care Unit, or ICU, Confinement Benefits add protection for intensive care stays. 

Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement Benefits extend coverage for multiple days. 

Some plans include Surgical and Ambulance Benefits for protection. 

---- Offered through BWA ----

Let's talk about what is offered through the Business Workers of America association. 

Medical Bill Repricing, which we'll call MBR, negotiates hospital and medical bills on behalf of members, lowering out-of-pocket expenses. 

A Reference-Based Pricing System ensures fair and competitive rates from healthcare providers. 

Financial Assistance Guidance helps members handle billing issues and navigate the payment process.

Members can also access Prescription Savings Programs through HealthWarehouse to help save on medications.

---- Additional Benefits Through BWA ----

Now let's explore the additional benefits offered through BWA.

For labs, DirectLabs makes it convenient for members to obtain recommended lab tests without hassle.

Members also have access to telehealth services. You can reach healthcare providers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through Virtual Doctor Visits, avoiding inconvenient clinic appointments. There are no consultation fees, meaning members can consult a doctor as often as needed. This service is both convenient and efficient and can also provide necessary prescriptions. Finally, the plan includes concierge-style healthcare advocacy to guide members through provider selection and explain plan benefits. 

There's support for finding financial assistance options when needed, and we offer help throughout the claims process to reduce confusion and stress.

BWA association benefits are not affiliated with BCS Insurance Company. The benefits listed are not insurance and do not provide coverage, they only provide discounts and services. Benefit discounts and services vary by state and plan level.

---- Accident and AD&D Benefits ----

Additionally, we offer Accident and Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits, also known as AD&D.

The Group AD&D Only Insurance offers a maximum benefit of ten thousand dollars. This is a group insurance benefit or each covered member of the family Accidental Dismemberment for loss of limb or sight according to the schedule.

The Group AD&D Only Insurance offers a maximum benefit of ten thousand dollars.

These benefits are underwritten by National Family Care Life Insurance Company.

BWA membership provides group accident and AD&D benefits through National Family Care Life Insurance Company. These benefits require BWA membership, vary by state, and are not affiliated with BCS Insurance Company.

---- Paramount Plans 4, 5 & 6 (1/2) ----

Now let's review the Paramount plan options.

All three plans - Paramount 4, 5, and 6 - offer identical benefits.

This comprehensive coverage includes a First Day Hospital Confinement payment of $1,000, plus a separate $200 first-day benefit for ICU. Daily Hospital and ICU Confinement coverage of $100 and $200 respectively continues beyond the first day. 

There's a $200 Emergency Room Treatment benefit and coverage for Chiropractic Visits at $25, Doctor's Office Visits at $50, and Urgent Care at $125. 

Air and Ground Ambulance benefits of $100 each are included, along with a $50 annual Wellness Visit allowance.

---- Paramount Plans 4, 5 & 6 (2/2) ----

Important to note for all three plans: 

Pre-Existing Condition Limitations apply for the first 12 months. Normal Pregnancy Coverage is included, with no waiting period. 

However, Portability is not provided for these plans. 

There's no Annual Benefit Maximum, and no Benefit Waiting Period beyond enrollment. Benefits reduce to 75% at age 70.

---- share well Health Share Benefit ----

Now let's talk about the share well Health Share benefit that's included with these plans.

share well is a health sharing community where members voluntarily contribute to help each other with medical expenses, following established Member Guidelines.

Each plan offers different Unshared Amount options, which is the member's responsibility before expenses become eligible for sharing. Paramount 4 has a six thousand dollar UA with lower monthly contributions. Paramount 5 offers a three thousand dollar UA with moderate monthly contributions. And Paramount 6 provides a fifteen hundred dollar UA with higher monthly contributions.

Here's how share well works in three simple steps: First, submit a Sharing Request by contacting share well before any medical appointment, except in emergencies. Their Medical Advocacy team helps navigate the healthcare experience. Second, present yourself as a Self-Pay Patient at appointments, since share well is not insurance. Third, eligible medical expenses are shared among community members, with share well coordinating provider payments when requests are approved.

For pre-existing conditions, there's a 24-month lookback period with phase-in sharing limits. Year one has a waiting period with zero dollars shared. Year two allows up to thirty thousand per need. Year three increases to sixty thousand per need. Year four goes up to one hundred fifty thousand. And year five and beyond removes the sharing maximum for pre-existing conditions. Important exceptions include controlled conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, thyroid conditions, and type 2 diabetes, which aren't considered pre-existing as long as there was no hospitalization in the 12 months before enrollment.

---- share well Benefits Comparison ----

Let's compare the share well benefits across all three Paramount plans. First, let me define the Unshared Amount, or UA. This is the amount a member must contribute as their responsibility before expenses become eligible for sharing with the community. The key difference between plans is the Unshared Amount: Paramount 4 has a six thousand dollar UA with lower monthly contributions, Paramount 5 has a three thousand dollar UA with moderate contributions, and Paramount 6 has a fifteen hundred dollar UA with higher monthly contributions. All plans have no annual or lifetime limits on eligible expenses, and all follow the same pre-existing condition phase-in schedule. Remember, share well is not affiliated with BCS Insurance Company or BWA. This is not insurance and not a qualified health plan under the Affordable Care Act. Members remain financially liable for any unpaid medical needs if sharing is insufficient.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

Now let's review the important limitations and exclusions that apply to these plans.

Pre-Existing Conditions are defined as any medical condition for which treatment was received in the 12 months before either the coverage effective date or any increase in benefits. This includes both when coverage first begins and when any benefits are added or increased later.

For Risky Behavior exclusions, the plan doesn't cover self-inflicted injuries, voluntary intoxication, felonies, or incidents during incarceration.

Aviation and Vehicle exclusions include flying as pilot or crew member, experimental aircraft, racing, and stunts.

Extreme Sports exclusions cover professional sports participation, base jumping, mountain climbing, skydiving, and similar high-risk activities.

Military and War exclusions apply to active duty service longer than 31 days, war involvement, and travel outside the United States or Canada.

Medical exclusions include pregnancy except for complications, mental health and substance abuse unless specifically allowed, cosmetic surgery, and dental care except for injury or congenital conditions.

Remember to review all these limitations thoroughly with each member to ensure they understand what's excluded before enrollment.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

Remember these important points: 

MBR Services can significantly reduce members' medical bills. 

Telemedicine and Prescription Savings are standard features across all plans. 

Wellness and Labs benefits are designed to keep members healthier in the long run. 

And don't forget that BWA membership is required to access these plan benefits.

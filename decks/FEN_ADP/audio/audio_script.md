Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the FEN_ADP Plan. Together, we'll explore the comprehensive benefits and details of this plan. Let's dive right in!

---- Plan Overview ----

The FEN_ADP Plan, brought to you by the National Congress of Employers and administered by Ameritas, provides a comprehensive benefits package. This plan combines dental and eye care under the FUSION plan and is crafted to meet the diverse needs of our members. With a strong focus on flexibility and immediate access to services, members can enjoy significant savings. What's more, you have the opportunity to utilize up to one thousand dollars for dental expenses and one hundred dollars for eye care within the annual coverage cap of one thousand dollars.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let’s take a closer look at the key features and benefits of the FEN_ADP Plan. You’ll find comprehensive coverage for both dental and eye care services. One of the standout features is that there are no waiting periods for dental benefits, allowing you to access care right when you need it. Additionally, the plan offers access to a large network of healthcare providers, ensuring that you have plenty of choices.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Managing costs effectively is crucial, and this plan offers excellent tools to help you do just that. With access to a vast network, you can enjoy significant savings by staying in-network. The claims process is streamlined for your convenience, and you’ll have access to support services around the clock. Whether you need assistance with claims or have questions about your benefits, support is just a call away.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Preventive care is a cornerstone of the FEN_ADP Plan, ensuring you stay on top of your health with ease. The dental coverage is divided into three categories: Preventive, Basic, and Major procedures. In terms of eye care, you’ll be covered for exams, lenses, and frames, each with specified allowances that help manage costs effectively.

---- Plan Tiers and Benefits ----

Exploring the plan tiers and benefits, the FEN_ADP Dental Plan offers a structured approach. For Type One, which is Preventive, coverage is at one hundred percent, with services like routine exams, bitewing X-rays, and cleanings included, all with a zero-dollar deductible. For Type Two, which is Basic, coverage remains at one hundred percent, covering services such as restorative amalgams and composites, nonsurgical endodontics, and simple extractions. Here, a fifty-dollar deductible per person per calendar year applies, with a family maximum of one hundred fifty dollars.

---- Plan Tiers and Benefits (Two of Two) ----

Continuing onto Type Three, which is Major, you’ll find one hundred percent coverage for services like surgical extractions, crowns, and prosthodontics, which includes bridges and dentures. The deductible is the same as Basic, with fifty dollars per person per year and one hundred fifty dollars for a family maximum. Importantly, the annual benefit maximum for Type One, Two, and Three combined is one thousand dollars per person per calendar year.

---- Comparison of the Plans ----

Let’s now compare the three plan types. All offer one hundred percent coverage, but they vary in deductibles and services. Type One Preventive has a zero-dollar deductible and covers exams, X-rays, and cleanings. Type Two Basic includes restorative work and extractions with a fifty-dollar deductible. Type Three Major covers surgical procedures and prosthodontics, also with a fifty-dollar deductible. Each type shares the same annual maximum of one thousand dollars.

---- Definitions and Limitations ----

Understanding the definitions and limitations is key. The deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before your benefits kick in. The maximum covered expense refers to the highest fee allowed for a covered service. In-network allowance means you benefit from discounted fees when using services within the network. Also, remember certain major procedures, like crowns, are limited to once every ten years.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

As we wrap up, here are some key takeaways. The FEN_ADP Plan offers immediate access to a broad range of dental and eye care services, with no waiting periods and significant in-network savings. The high coverage percentages ensure you face minimal out-of-pocket costs, and you have the flexibility to choose your providers while still enjoying substantial savings. Don’t forget to review the plan details, confirm provider participation, and reach out to customer service for any questions or to enroll.

      "summary": "The Medical Bill Repricer is a key feature in the Managed Care Benefit Package, designed to simplify the healthcare billing process. It addresses the complexity of medical bills, which often include various charges such as hospital room fees, surgical fees, and specialist fees. The Repricer uses 'Reference Based Pricing' to manage costs, allowing providers to be paid between 150% to 200% of Medicare Allowable Rates. This method is widely accepted by doctors and medical facilities, helping to lower the cost of provider fees compared to traditional PPO networks.\n\nMembers can benefit from a $25 pre-pay for doctor office visits or a $50 pre-pay for specialist visits, without the need to use a network doctor. The service includes assistance in locating providers and setting appointments. The Repricer also offers an Advocacy Service, which helps members understand their benefits and negotiate with providers to reduce any remaining balances after insurance payments. This service ensures that members are not limited to network providers and can choose their own doctors.\n\nThe plan includes detailed instructions on how to use the Pre-Pay Doctor Visit benefit, emphasizing the role of the Medical Bill Repricer in explaining benefits, assisting with claims, and providing necessary support to minimize member responsibilities.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus Plans. We'll walk through these plans' features and benefits, designed to provide valuable healthcare solutions for your members. Let's get started!\n\n---- Plan Overview ----\n\nThe Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus Plans\n\nare managed care options with no waiting or exclusion periods for pre-existing conditions, provided through American Public Life Insurance Company.\n\nThese plans offer Indemnity Insurance, which means you receive a set payment amount with specific daily limits.\n\nMembers can benefit from the Free Prescription Club and telemedicine services.\n\nAdditionally, the plans include a Medical Bill Repricer through Reference Based Pricing.\n\nAdvocacy Services are also available to support members.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nLet's explore the key features and benefits of these plans.\n\nManaged Care is a central feature, ensuring members have access to necessary services without delay.\n\nIndemnity Insurance provides financial support with predetermined daily limits.\n\nThe Free Prescription Club offers varying benefits depending on the plan.\n\nTelemedicine Services are available through virtual consultations, enhancing accessibility.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nNow, let's discuss the cost management tools available with these plans.\n\nThe Medical Bill Repricer, or MBR, helps manage healthcare expenses effectively.\n\nThe Reference Based Pricing System ensures fair pricing for medical services.\n\nAdvocacy Services provide additional support in navigating healthcare costs.\n\n---- How Medical Bill Repricer Works ----\n\nHere's how the Medical Bill Repricer works.\n\nFirst, members enroll through American Public Life Insurance Company.\n\nThey can use a twenty-five dollar pre-pay for doctor visits or fifty dollars for specialist visits.\n\nMBR explains benefits and assists with claims, ensuring clarity.\n\nMembers receive Reference Based Pricing, or RBP, for their services.\n\nImportantly, they can choose any doctor without network restrictions.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nPreventive care and wellness are integral to these plans.\n\nMembers have access to Free Prescription Club Services.\n\nTelemedicine Programs offer convenient healthcare access.\n\nThe Patient Assistance Program provides affordable medication options.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nLet's talk about telehealth services.\n\nMembers enjoy unlimited virtual doctor visits.\n\nThey have twenty-four-seven access to care.\n\nNo-cost consultations are available, enhancing affordability.\n\nImmediate prescriptions can be sent to local pharmacies.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nAdvocacy and support services are key components.\n\nConcierge Healthcare Advocacy assists members with their healthcare needs.\n\nProvider Negotiation helps manage costs effectively.\n\nClaims Filing options simplify the process for members.\n\nCost Reduction support is available to minimize expenses.\n\n---- Plan Tier 1 (One of Two) ----\n\nLet's examine our first plan tier, the Basic Core Plan.\n\nIndemnity Insurance provides five hundred dollars per day for one day for hospital admission, one hundred dollars per day for up to ten days for hospital daily confinement, fifty dollars per day for one day for emergency room visits, and fifty dollars per day for up to three days for urgent care.\n\nThe Free Prescription Club offers a Discount Rx Card.\n\nTelemedicine Services are not available in this plan.\n\n---- Plan Tier 1 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with the Basic Core Plan.\n\nThe Medical Bill Repricer includes a twenty-five dollar prepay for doctor visits and a fifty dollar prepay for specialist visits.\n\nAdvocacy Services are included to support members.\n\n---- Plan Tier 2 (One of Two) ----\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier, the Basic Core-Plus Plan.\n\nIndemnity Insurance offers the same benefits as the Basic Core Plan, with five hundred dollars per day for one day for hospital admission, one hundred dollars per day for up to ten days for hospital daily confinement, fifty dollars per day for one day for emergency room visits, and fifty dollars per day for up to three days for urgent care.\n\nThe Free Prescription Club provides Free Generic Medications with zero copay.\n\nTelemedicine Services include unlimited visits, available twenty-four hours a day with zero copay.\n\n---- Plan Tier 2 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with the Basic Core-Plus Plan.\n\nThe Medical Bill Repricer features a twenty-five dollar prepay for doctor visits and a fifty dollar prepay for specialist visits.\n\nAdvocacy Services are included to assist members.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\nBoth plans have no waiting or exclusion periods for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNeither plan covers pregnancy.\n\nHospital admission and daily confinement benefits are identical in both plans.\n\nThe Basic Core-Plus Plan offers additional benefits like Free Generic Medications and unlimited telemedicine visits.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\nIndemnity Insurance provides set payments, such as five hundred dollars per day for one day for hospital admission and one hundred dollars per day for up to ten days for hospital daily confinement.\n\nThe Free Prescription Club offers a Discount Rx Card in the Basic Core Plan.\n\nTelemedicine Services are not available in the Basic Core Plan.\n\nAdvocacy Services are included in both plans.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\nManaged Care benefits are a highlight of these plans.\n\nIndemnity Insurance is included to support members financially.\n\nThe Free Prescription Club offers valuable benefits.\n\nEnrollment is required to access these services.\n\n---- Closing ----\n\nThank you for your time today. We hope this information helps you assist members in making informed decisions about their health coverage. Continue to be great!",

## Important Definitions

<v-click>

**Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB)**

An advance payment of part or all of a life insurance policy's death benefit if the insured is diagnosed with a terminal illness or qualifying condition. The payment is deducted (with any interest or fees) from the policy's face amount, reducing the death benefit paid to beneficiaries. Receiving an ADB may affect taxes or eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid.

</v-click>

<v-click>

**You can request an ADB if you're:**
- Terminally ill (life expectancy **12 months or less**)
- Unable to do **two or more daily living activities** on your own
- **Cognitively impaired** (advanced dementia or Alzheimer's)

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Conversion Right**

Lets a certificateholder change (convert) all or part of their group life insurance coverage into an individual permanent life insurance policy **without medical evidence** if certain events occur — such as leaving the eligible class, ending employment, the group policy ending, or a reduction in coverage.

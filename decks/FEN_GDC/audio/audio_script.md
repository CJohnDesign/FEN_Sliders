Hello! Thank you for joining today's training session on Golden Care Plan Overview. Let's get started!

---- Introduction to Golden Care ----

Golden Care, underwritten by Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company of America, 

is a Group Term Life insurance product with Accelerated Death Benefit and Accidental Death & Dismemberment coverage.

When presenting to prospects, emphasize how this plan provides financial protection with life insurance that can be accessed during terminal illness, combined with accidental death and dismemberment benefits to protect families during life's most challenging moments.

Membership is available through the Association for Entrepreneurship USA, which you should refer to as AFE when speaking with prospects, granting access to these exclusive benefits along with valuable discounts for startups, self-employed individuals, gig workers, and small businesses.

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Let's explore the key features you'll be highlighting to prospects. 

Guaranteed Issue Member Coverage provides ten thousand dollars of life insurance with no medical exam required and a six-month waiting period, making enrollment simple and accessible.

Age Eligibility covers individuals ages 18 and up, ensuring broad access to this valuable protection.

Coverage Effective Date is the first of the month following enrollment.

The Free Look Period gives members 30 days to review their coverage and make changes if needed.

Accelerated Death Benefit allows members to access to up to 75 percent of their face amount if they are terminally ill with a life expectancy of 12 months or less, unable to do two or more daily living activities on their own, or cognitively impaired such as with advanced dementia or Alzheimer's. 

The Conversion Right lets a certificateholder change all or part of their group life insurance coverage into an individual permanent life insurance policy without providing medical evidence of insurability if certain events occur, such as leaving the eligible class, ending employment, the group policy ending, or a reduction in coverage.

Voluntary Accidental Death & Dismemberment coverage provides one hundred percent of the life insurance benefit as the principal sum, with the accidental death common carrier benefit paying one hundred percent of AD&D benefit up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

Age and Rate Adjustments are important for members to understand. For rate purposes, the member's age updates once a year on the Equitable group's anniversary date, which is October. Equitable's rates are age banded, which means the member's age determines the rate of their policy. If a member enrolls after the anniversary date, their age is based on the date of enrollment. Once the member reaches age 60, their rates will adjust on the next group anniversary date following their 60th birthday.

---- AFE Association Benefits ----

When discussing the association benefits offered through Association for Entrepreneurship USA, you'll want to emphasize the extensive value proposition for entrepreneurs and small business owners.

AFE provides its members with discounts for various services that can benefit startups, self-employed individuals, gig workers, and small businesses alike. These discounts can help members save money on essential services such as marketing, accounting, and legal services.

Whether members are just starting out or they're an established business owner, AFE has created a large portfolio of products and services to support their business needs. The discount benefit categories include health and wellness services, automotive savings, travel benefits, pet care, fitness and wellness, mental health services, food and nutrition, home and lifestyle services, retail and shopping discounts, and business and education resources. Remember to mention that Association for Entrepreneurship AFE association benefits are not affiliated with Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company of America. The Golden Care benefits are not dependent on the use of the association's providers. AFE membership is available without purchasing this plan. The benefits listed are not insurance and do not provide coverage, they only provide discounts and services. Benefit discounts and services vary by state.

---- Life Insurance Reductions ----

It's important to understand how coverage adjusts with age so you can properly set expectations with prospects.

Upon the member's attainment of age 65 and over, the life insurance scheduled benefit amount will automatically reduce to 50 percent of the original amount. At age 75 and over, coverage reduces to 25 percent of the original amount. At age 85 and over, life insurance coverage reduces to zero percent of the original amount.

For Accidental Death & Dismemberment, coverage reduces to zero percent of the original amount at age 85 and over. Any reduction takes place on the next policyholder anniversary date.

---- Accidental Dismemberment Benefits ----

Now let's review the extensive dismemberment benefits you'll be presenting to prospects, 

with percentages based on the AD&D Principal Sum.

The one hundred percent benefit level covers the most severe dismemberments including loss of both hands or both feet, loss of one hand and one foot, loss of sight in both eyes, loss of hand or foot and sight in one eye, or quadriplegia. Paraplegia provides 75 percent of the principal sum.

The fifty percent benefit level covers significant dismemberments including loss of one hand or one foot, loss of hearing in both ears, loss of sight in one eye, loss of speech, or hemiplegia.

Uniplegia, loss of all fingers on one hand, or loss of all toes on one foot provides twenty-five percent of the principal sum.

It is important to review the product certificate for complete benefit details.

---- Important Definitions ----

Now let's examine the key definitions you need to understand and communicate to prospects.

Accelerated Death Benefit is an advance payment of part or all of a life insurance policy's death benefit if the insured is diagnosed with a terminal illness or qualifying condition. To receive it, the policyholder must provide medical proof of the diagnosis and meet the insurer's eligibility requirements. The payment is deducted, with any interest or fees, from the policy's face amount, reducing the death benefit paid to beneficiaries when the insured dies. Receiving an ADB may affect taxes or eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid.

You can request an Accelerated Death Benefit if you're terminally ill with a life expectancy of 12 months or less, unable to do two or more daily living activities on your own, or cognitively impaired such as advanced dementia or Alzheimer's.

The Conversion Right lets a certificateholder change, or convert, all or part of their group life insurance coverage into an individual permanent life insurance policy without providing medical evidence of insurability if certain events occur, such as leaving the eligible class, ending employment, the group policy ending, or a reduction in coverage.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

As agents, you need to understand the key exclusions for Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits to properly set expectations with your prospects.

Key exclusions include losses caused or contributed to by disease, infirmity, or medical treatment, as well as suicide or self-inflicted injury.

Additional exclusions include war, military service, or terrorism, as well as intoxication or illegal drug use.

Coverage is also excluded for felony or illegal activity, and extreme sports such as skydiving, rock climbing, and similar high-risk activities.

Finally, racing or stunt activities and non-passenger aircraft travel are excluded.

This is a brief overview of some key exclusions. As agents, please review all policy materials thoroughly with your prospective members to ensure they understand the complete list of exclusions and limitations.

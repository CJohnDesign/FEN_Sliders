---- Harmony Care Plus Plan Options ----

Now let's review the Harmony Care Plus plan options you'll be presenting to prospects. You'll be offering eight different plan levels to meet various needs and budgets, ranging from Plan 100A up to Plan 1000. 

When presenting Hospital Confinement Benefits, you can show prospects the range from one hundred dollars per day on the lower plans up to one thousand dollars per day on the highest plan. All plans provide coverage for up to 30 days per year.

For Doctor Visit Benefits, point out this important distinction to prospects. Most plans provide fifty dollars per visit for both primary care and specialty care, while Plan 1000 increases this to seventy-five dollars per visit.

Visit Limits also vary by plan level, giving you another selling point. The lower plans allow 3 visits per year for each category, while the higher plans allow 5 visits per year.

Finally, Emergency Room benefits highlight a key difference you should explain clearly. Plan 100A doesn't include emergency room coverage at all, while other plans range from fifty dollars to one hundred dollars per visit, with most plans allowing one emergency room visit per year.

This flexible structure allows you to help prospects choose the plan that best matches their healthcare needs and budget.

---- Additional Benefits - Diagnostics & Surgery ----

Now let's examine the additional benefits available on higher-tier plans.

When presenting diagnostic benefits, explain to prospects that certain plans include coverage for essential medical tests. Plans 200, 200 Plus, 500, 750, and 1000 provide Basic Pathology and Basic Radiology benefits with Plan 1000 offering the highest benefit at seventy-five dollars per day.

Surgery Benefits really differentiate the higher plans. Starting with Plan 200 Plus, prospects get both inpatient and outpatient surgery coverage ranging from four hundred dollars per day up to fifteen hundred dollars per day on Plan 1000. All surgery plans allow up to 3 procedures per year.

The Anesthesia Benefit provides an additional twenty percent of the surgery benefit amount, giving prospects even more value for surgical procedures.

Remember the important limitations: for diagnostic tests, if multiple tests occur on the same day, only the highest benefit amount is paid. For surgery, if both inpatient and outpatient procedures happen the same day, only the inpatient benefit is paid.

---- Mental Health Benefits ----

Mental Health Benefits represent a significant differentiator starting with Plan 300.

Plans 300 through 1000 provide inpatient mental health benefits ranging from one hundred fifty dollars per day up to five hundred dollars per day on Plan 1000, with coverage of up to 60 days per year. All these higher-tier plans also include outpatient mental health benefits at fifty dollars per day for up to 20 visits annually.

These Mental Health Benefits are only available on Plans 300 and higher, providing essential coverage for mental healthcare needs.

---- Premium Accident & Critical Illness Benefits ----

Now let's explore the accident and critical illness benefits that create additional value propositions across multiple plan levels.

Supplemental Accident Benefits are a powerful selling tool available on Plans 300 and higher. These benefits are crucial because they pay in addition to regular hospital and emergency room benefits, effectively doubling the coverage for accident-related care. For accident-related emergency room visits, prospects receive an additional two hundred fifty dollars per day. For accident-related hospital admissions, they receive an additional five hundred dollars per day, with higher plans offering more days of coverage.

Accidental Death Benefits provide peace of mind and are available on all plans except 100A. You can position this as a ten thousand dollar accidental death benefit at no additional cost. Remember to explain that spouses receive fifty percent, or five thousand dollars, and dependents receive twenty-five percent, or twenty-five hundred dollars.

Critical Illness Benefits start with Plan 200 Plus and provide one thousand dollars per original diagnosis per family member. This is particularly appealing to prospects with family histories of serious illness, as it provides immediate cash assistance when facing major health challenges like cancer, heart attack, or stroke.

These accident and critical illness benefits transform the plans from simple hospital coverage into protection packages.

---- Laboratory Benefits ----

QuestSelect Laboratory Benefits are available across all plan levels at no additional cost.

These unlimited laboratory services include blood testing, urinalysis, pap smears, biopsies, and cultures through the Quest Diagnostics network, providing immediate value for every prospect regardless of which plan they choose.

---- Limitations and Exclusions ----

As agents, you need to understand the key limitations of Harmony Care Plus plans to properly set expectations with your prospects.

There's a thirty-day waiting period for sickness benefits and 

a twelve-month exclusion for pre-existing conditions treated before coverage begins.

The main exclusions include treatments that aren't medically necessary, experimental procedures, dental care except for accidents, cosmetic surgery, 

self-inflicted injuries, extreme sports, military duty, and work-related injuries covered by Workers' Compensation.

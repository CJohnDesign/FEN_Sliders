Hello, everyone! Thank [1s] you for joining [2s] today's session on [3s] the MyChoice Plan. [4s] We'll walk through [5s] the plan's [6s] benefits, explain how [7s] it helps control [8s] healthcare costs, and [9s] discuss how membership [10s] through the Business [11s] Workers of America [12s] (BWA) makes these [13s] benefits possible.

---- MyChoice Plan Overview ----

The MyChoice Plan [1s] offers hospital indemnity [2s] insurance through Business [3s] Workers of America [4s] (BWA), providing flexible [5s] coverage for various [6s] medical situations. This [7s] plan includes [8s] extensive benefits and [9s] support tools designed [10s] to help members [11s] navigate their healthcare [12s] journey effectively. One [13s] of its key [14s] advantages is significant [15s] cost savings through [16s] medical bill repricing, [17s] along with extensive [18s] support to help [19s] members understand and [20s] maximize their benefits. [21s]

---- Key Features and Benefits ----

Hospital Admission Benefits [1s] give members financial [2s] support when they're [3s] admitted to a [4s] hospital. ICU Confinement [5s] Benefits provide an [6s] additional layer of [7s] protection for intensive [8s] care stays. Daily [9s] Hospital and ICU [10s] Confinement Benefits extend [11s] coverage for multiple [12s] days. Certain plans [13s] include Surgical and [14s] Ambulance Benefits for [15s] more protection. [16s] Prescription Savings Programs [17s] through HealthWarehouse help [18s] members save on [19s] medications.

---- Cost Management Tools ----

Medical Bill Repricing [1s] (MBR) negotiates hospital [2s] and medical bills [3s] on behalf of [4s] members, lowering out-of-pocket [5s] expenses. A Reference-Based [6s] Pricing System ensures [7s] fair and competitive [8s] rates from healthcare [9s] providers. Financial Assistance [10s] Guidance helps members [11s] handle billing issues [12s] and navigate the [13s] payment process.

---- How the Plan Works ----

Members enroll through [1s] BWA and then [2s] seek healthcare services [3s] as needed. Medical [4s] bills are submitted [5s] to MBR, and [6s] after negotiation, members [7s] receive an Explanation [8s] of Benefits (EOB). [9s] The final step [10s] is paying the [11s] reduced balance, simplifying [12s] the process and [13s] providing valuable cost [14s] savings.

---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----

Annual Wellness Exams [1s] help detect health [2s] issues early. Preventive [3s] Screenings address potential [4s] risks before they [5s] become serious. DirectLabs [6s] makes it straightforward [7s] for members to [8s] obtain recommended lab [9s] tests without hassle. [10s]

---- Telehealth Services ----

24/7 Virtual Doctor [1s] Visits allow access [2s] to healthcare providers [3s] anytime, avoiding inconvenient [4s] clinic appointments. No [5s] Consultation Fees mean [6s] members can consult [7s] a doctor as [8s] often as needed. [9s] This service is [10s] both convenient and [11s] efficient, and it [12s] can also provide [13s] necessary prescriptions.

---- Advocacy and Support Services ----

Concierge-style healthcare advocacy [1s] guides members through [2s] provider selection and [3s] explains plan benefits. [4s] There's support for [5s] finding financial assistance [6s] options if needed. [7s] Additionally, the plan [8s] offers help throughout [9s] the claims process [10s] to reduce confusion [11s] and stress.

---- MyChoice Low Plan (1/2) ----

Let's examine the [1s] Low Plan's hospital [2s] benefits first. It [3s] provides $100 per [4s] day for Hospital [5s] Confinement and $200 [6s] for ICU Confinement. [7s] There's a generous [8s] First Day Hospital [9s] Admission benefit of [10s] $1,000, and the [11s] Hospital Benefits Year [12s] Maximum is set [13s] at $1,000,000. For [14s] emergency services, the [15s] plan includes a [16s] $200 Emergency Room [17s] benefit and both [18s] ground and air [19s] ambulance coverage at [20s] $100 each. Outpatient [21s] care includes a [22s] $50 benefit for [23s] both office visits [24s] and wellness visits, [25s] with a Calendar [26s] Year Maximum of [27s] $4,000.

---- MyChoice Low Plan (2/2) ----

The Low Plan [1s] includes important plan [2s] limits and features. [3s] There's a substantial [4s] Lifetime Maximum of [5s] $5,000,000, and pre-existing [6s] conditions are subject [7s] to a 12/12 [8s] limitation. The plan [9s] includes portability, allowing [10s] members to maintain [11s] coverage even after [12s] leaving their employer. [13s] While this plan [14s] provides essential coverage, [15s] it does not [16s] include surgical benefits. [17s]

---- MyChoice Mid Plan (1/2) ----

The Mid Plan [1s] enhances hospital benefits [2s] significantly. Hospital Confinement [3s] increases to $300 [4s] per day, and [5s] ICU Confinement rises [6s] to $500 per [7s] day. It maintains [8s] the same $1,000 [9s] First Day Hospital [10s] Admission benefit and [11s] $1,000,000 Hospital Benefits [12s] Year Maximum. Emergency [13s] services include the [14s] same $200 Emergency [15s] Room benefit, with [16s] ground ambulance at [17s] $100 and increased [18s] air ambulance coverage [19s] at $200. Outpatient [20s] care remains consistent [21s] with $50 benefits [22s] for both office [23s] and wellness visits, [24s] maintaining the $4,000 [25s] Calendar Year Maximum. [26s]

---- MyChoice Mid Plan (2/2) ----

Like the Low [1s] Plan, the Mid [2s] Plan features a [3s] $5,000,000 Lifetime Maximum [4s] and the same [5s] 12/12 pre-existing conditions [6s] limitation. Portability is [7s] included, and while [8s] this plan offers [9s] enhanced hospital benefits, [10s] it also does [11s] not include surgical [12s] coverage.

---- MyChoice High Plan (1/2) ----

The High Plan [1s] maintains the Mid [2s] Plan's enhanced hospital [3s] benefits of $300 [4s] per day for [5s] Hospital Confinement and [6s] $500 for ICU [7s] Confinement, along with [8s] the $1,000 First [9s] Day Hospital Admission [10s] and $1,000,000 Hospital [11s] Benefits Year Maximum. [12s] Emergency services include [13s] the standard $200 [14s] Emergency Room benefit, [15s] $100 ground ambulance, [16s] and an increased [17s] air ambulance benefit [18s] of $300. What [19s] sets this plan [20s] apart is its [21s] surgical benefits [22s] package, which includes [23s] a 1x Surgical [24s] Schedule, $500 Ambulatory [25s] Outpatient Facility benefit, [26s] and both Assistant [27s] Surgeon and Anesthesia [28s] coverage at 1x [29s] the Surgical Schedule. [30s]

---- MyChoice High Plan (2/2) ----

For outpatient care, [1s] the High Plan [2s] increases the office [3s] visit benefit to [4s] $75 while maintaining [5s] the $50 wellness [6s] visit benefit and [7s] $4,000 Calendar Year [8s] Maximum. The plan [9s] maintains the same [10s] robust $5,000,000 Lifetime [11s] Maximum and 12/12 [12s] pre-existing conditions limitation. [13s] Portability is included, [14s] making this the [15s] most plan [16s] option with its [17s] addition of surgical [18s] benefits.

---- Comparing the 3 MyChoice Plans ----

The Low Plan [1s] provides basic Hospital [2s] and ICU Confinement [3s] benefits with standard [4s] office visit coverage. [5s] The Mid Plan [6s] increases hospital benefits [7s] and Air Ambulance [8s] coverage. The High [9s] Plan offers the [10s] most coverage, [11s] including increased office [12s] visit benefits and [13s] surgical coverage, plus [14s] the highest Air [15s] Ambulance benefit.

---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----

MBR Services can [1s] help significantly reduce [2s] members' medical bills. [3s] Telemedicine and Prescription [4s] Savings are standard [5s] features. Preventive Care [6s] and Wellness benefits [7s] are designed to [8s] keep members healthier [9s] in the long [10s] run. Finally, remember [11s] that BWA membership [12s] is required to [13s] access these plan [14s] benefits.

---- Definitions and Limitations ----

Let me highlight [1s] the key limitations [2s] of each benefit [3s] category. For hospital [4s] benefits, there's a [5s] 10-day maximum per [6s] stay for both [7s] regular rooms and [8s] ICU. Emergency Room [9s] coverage is limited [10s] to one visit [11s] per day.

Surgical benefits follow [1s] a set schedule [2s] that determines payment [3s] amounts for procedures, [4s] anesthesia, and assistant [5s] surgeons. All surgical [6s] benefits are subject [7s] to the calendar [8s] year maximum.

For doctor visits, [1s] the plan allows [2s] up to 3 [3s] office visits and [4s] 1 wellness visit [5s] per year. Note [6s] that office and [7s] wellness benefits cannot [8s] be combined for [9s] the same visit. [10s]

Finally, understand that [1s] pre-existing conditions have [2s] a 12-month waiting [3s] period, portability is [4s] available after 6 [5s] months of coverage, [6s] and all coverage [7s] ends at age [8s] 70. Please review [9s] these details carefully [10s] with your clients. [11s]

Membership includes access to valuable benefits and superior customer service. Upon successful enrollment, members receive a confirmation email with a membership handbook and insurance certificate.

An initial, non-refundable enrollment fee is charged at the time of enrollment. Future payments are drafted monthly, and members are advised to ensure sufficient funds are available. \n\nThe plan offers limited medical coverage, which is not intended to replace major medical plans. It provides basic insurance coverage with capped amounts for specific services. This plan is suitable when major medical insurance is not an option, is too costly, or when supplementing a high-deductible major medical plan. Eligibility is open to adults aged 65 and older, and dependent children aged 1-25.",

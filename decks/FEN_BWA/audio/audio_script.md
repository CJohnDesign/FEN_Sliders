Hello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on Business Workers of America, or BWA. We'll walk through what associations are, how they work, and the valuable benefits BWA offers to its members.

---- What is an Association? ----

Let's begin with understanding what an association is. At its core, associations are organizations formed to serve collective member interests. They provide access to various important services, with a particular focus on health insurance plans. The key strength of an association lies in its ability to leverage collective purchasing power, allowing it to negotiate better terms and coverage for all its members.

---- How Associations Work ----

Now, let me explain how associations operate. An association acts as an intermediary between providers and members, playing a crucial role in negotiating group rates and terms. They manage the entire enrollment process and provide ongoing member support. Through this structure, they effectively coordinate benefit offerings for all members.

---- About BWA ----

BWA, or Business Workers of America, is a not-for-profit member association that was founded in 2006. Our mission is dedicated to improving workers' lives by enhancing their standard of living and providing access to valuable savings. We actively influence both federal and state legislation to benefit the American workforce, ensuring your interests are represented at every level.

---- BWA & Plan Relationship ----

Before we dive into the specific benefits, there's something important you need to understand about membership. A working membership is required to access our benefits. You must join the BWA Association to be eligible for plan benefits. This membership opens the door to both BWA Membership benefits and comprehensive health benefits.

---- MBR Benefits ----

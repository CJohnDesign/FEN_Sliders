**Added Dependencies:**
- `@supabase/supabase-js@^2.75.0` - Supabase client for temporary file storage
- `playwright-chromium@^1.48.2` - Browser automation for video recording
- `ora@^8.1.1` - Elegant terminal spinners

### .gitignore
**Added:**
- `exports/videos/` - Video output files (large files)
- `temp/video-export/` - Temporary recording files

---

## Deprecated Files (Marked for Future Cleanup)

The following files in `scripts/video-export/` are deprecated but kept for reference:

### ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Do Not Use
- `blackholeRecorder.js` - Old approach using BlackHole virtual audio device (macOS specific)
- `browserRecorderCDP.js` - Old Chrome DevTools Protocol approach (replaced by MediaRecorder API)
- `dualBrowserRecorder.js` - Experimental dual-browser approach (not needed)
- `puppeteerRecorder.js` - Old Puppeteer implementation (replaced by Playwright)
- `ffmpegRecorder.js` - Direct FFmpeg screen capture (replaced by browser MediaRecorder)
- `audioTimingHelper.js` - Manual audio sync helper (no longer needed)
- `audioTimingProcessor.js` - Manual audio sync processor (no longer needed)
- `audioProcessor.js` - Audio processing utilities (may be deprecated)

**Note:** These files are preserved for historical reference and should not be deleted without careful review. They contain valuable learnings about approaches that didn't work as well.

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **MediaRecorder API over CDP/FFmpeg**
   - More reliable audio capture
   - Better cross-platform compatibility
   - Simpler implementation

2. **Playwright over Puppeteer**
   - Better headless rendering
   - More stable automation
   - Better TypeScript support

3. **Supabase for Temporary Storage**
   - Simple public URL generation
   - No need for direct file access in MCP
   - Easy cleanup workflow

4. **Console Log End Detection**
   - More reliable than DOM inspection
   - Works in fullscreen mode
   - Simple to implement

---

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are additive and don't affect existing functionality.

---

## Migration Notes

### For Video Export
- Old manual OBS workflow still works
- New automated workflow is opt-in via `npm run export-video`
- No changes to presentation behavior

### For PDF Export
- Existing `npm run deck export {CODE}` still works
- Now includes automatic Supabase upload as bonus
- Google Drive upload still manual via Zapier MCP

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Automated Google Drive Upload** - Eliminate manual Zapier MCP step
2. **Automated YouTube Upload** - Complete end-to-end automation
3. **Batch Export** - Export multiple decks in sequence
4. **Quality Presets** - Easy quality selection (low/med/high)
5. **Progress Indicators** - Real-time export progress
6. **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry on transient failures

### Code Cleanup
1. Remove deprecated files after confirming they're not needed
2. Consolidate configuration files
3. Add TypeScript types for better IDE support
4. Add unit tests for critical paths
